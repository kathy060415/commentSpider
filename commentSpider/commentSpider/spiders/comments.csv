"April 02, 2017",2.5,"I love the style of white lettering, which is why I bought these tires. There were no other white letter tires in my size at the time. Looking back, I should have realised the Raadial T/A is essentially a muscle car tire, not an all season, all weather tire. Dry performance was outstanding. On a weekend driver in nice weather, I can think of no better tire. On my truck, which is a daily driven light weight 2WD open diff truck, these were not a good option. Wet traction is virtually non existent, which was made worse when the tread is worn. This review is not a slight against the tire at all... They simply weren't designed for what I put them through.

Next was 55 MPH straight road with momentary hands off steering wheel.  The car continued straight with no perceptible wandering.  Finally I did a 55 to 0 panic stop.

Very quiet at 70 MPH, track nicely on the highway and inspire confidence all around.  Can't comment on wear or weather yet, but for the money I'd be happy with one or two Summers of safe, fairly aggressive driving.  The look is perfect for the 70's classic and the size replicates the original rubber very well.  Speedometer is also spot on.

"April 25, 2014",4.0,"I had to put these tires on my lowered Ranger because they discontinued the Dunlops with RWL and I love RWL. My first complaint is tire noise. These are pretty loud (squealing) when burning out. Other tires I've had were much quieter. But for dry traction, I never had a harder launch at the track then with these. Truck corners amazing on dry pavement with the hammer down. Tread wear is ok, the fronts got choppy because of my negative camber where other brands did not. The rears always wear like they are over inflated even at 20psi! I am running 275/60r15 which is overkill for the truck, but I could have got more life if they had worn evenly.

They seemed to amplify ever bump in the road. The first thing that I noticed after I got the BFG's mounted on the car was how much smoother the ride was.

"February 17, 2012",4.5,"I replaced Goodyear Assurance tires with these BFGoodrich; so my comparison will be between these two tire brands.  The Goodyear's had excellent tread wear.  I put 90,000 miles on them before I had to replace them; but I hated every other aspect about them.  The ride was extremely rough and noisy (they were a higher speed rated tire).  They handled ok on dry surfaces, but was not a problem spinning them at take off.  Get them even just a little bit wet, and hang on.  The wet traction was horrible as was the hydroplaning.  From a standstill, say at a red light on a rainy day, or just tires wet from sprinkler runoff, you could not move the car without the tires spinning.  I'm not talking about opening up the throttle, just pushing the pedal to move the car, it was awful, like being on ice and was especially gut wrenching if you were in the middle of a turn as well.  Was not comfortable with my wife driving the car in wet weather, especially with the kids.  I have had the BFGoodrich Radial T/A now for about 2,000 miles.  Recently took a road trip to Nebraska and encountered snow and ice.  Same trip I encountered rain as well as dry pavement driving.  The tires performed amazing.  The ride is very smooth (not a very high speed rated tire) and quiet.  They handle great on the ice as well as in the light snow.  On wet pavement I had no problems with traction or hydroplaning.  From a standstill on wet pavement, traction is greatly improved, and spinning occurs only when I open up the throttle a little.  With only so few miles, I cannot really give my opinion on the treadwear.

However, with the torrential rains we get in FL, I have much experience with very wet road conditions.  Being on a pickup truck, spinning the wheels on wet roads can be very easy, but I find that these tires will really only spin on wet roads if you want them to.  When I got the truck, the tire had about 3/16s tread left on them.  I thought, 'Well, I'll be replacing them soon'.  But 16 months (and 19000 miles) later and they are still 1/32 above the wear bar.  Also, even with an inch of more of water on the road, I have never hydroplaned.  I stop and start quickly and tend speed most every I go (sorry, but it's the truth) and I have never had any issues with these tires performing wet or dry.

I keep my car in very good running condition, I have not changed my driving style, and I use the same gas as before.  But 1 year later after driving on them for 10,000 miles, I have never achieved more than 31 MPG.  My son urges me to increase the tire pressure from the usual 32 PSI to (perhaps) 36-38 PSI.  This should be dangerous, because the tire documents recommend 44 PSI as maximum.  I doubt that this additional pressure will add more than 2 or 3 MPG.  So the answer is to get rid of these tires and replace them with tires that will give me the previous 36-38 MPG.

There's lots of sidewall flex and rollover in corners and it feels more like I'm driving a Ford Taurus than a sports car.  Wet traction is poor, which is fun if you like drifting and fishtailing everywhere but pulling out in traffic or merging on onramps can be tricky- I dropped a gear and got these to spin at about 30 mph in the rain while getting onto a highway.  These tires are very soft and did take some of the notorious harshness out of the Trans Am's ride, and they give pretty good traction for the average driver and are a pretty good tire overall.

NOTHING changed except my tires. AS for traction goes, great in the rain, handles very nice, nearing the end of their life, but that's b/c the previous owner(a family member of mine) got lazy with the rotations and balancing but with snow, not the best, far from it actually, on a shoveled driveway with a thin layer of snow... not too pleased when i got stuck, its an awful snow tire deep or thin. Especially on driveways where theres a thin lawyer of snow with slick packed snow on the bottom. I wouldn't buy simply b/c I go in wet gravel roads, and the winters are tough here, i got stuck in my friends grass one to many times with these tires, if all you are driving on is roads with good pavement and dont go out in bad snow, they should perform nicely. They usually handle excess water quite well but once they start to hydroplane, they don't get the grip back quick. These tires simply dont fit my driving style and the winters  are just too harsh.

I may not be so demanding of tires so long as they hold up.  And this tire holds up.  I have owned 4 sets of BF Goodrick T/A and have never, I repeat, never had a flat.  Got a nail stuck in one-one time but it didnt go flat.  The warranty covered the repair.  The set of T/A tires Im running right now have at least 66,000 miles on them--and guess what, except for the corners, the tires look like they have only about half that many miles on them!  The funny things this time with this set of tires is Ive only had them rotated two times.  Im about to go get another set.  I dont drive crazy in rain and I slow down to about 35 or 40 mph in snow but they get me to where I am going.  I keep my wheels aligned and I adjust my driving for weather conditions.

Some sets would finally balance out, some wouldnt.  My current set never balanced out but BFG has gotten much more strict on what they consider to be a defective tire.

Although they seem better in the snow/slush than the tires they replaced (""Dean Stingers""), my old tires only had 2-3/32"" of tread left and were about the cheapest tire you can buy.  Grip in all conditions is mediocre at best.  Dry grip is good enough for my relatively underpowered car, but wet/snow/ice traction is poor.  Ride quality and noise are not bad.  I cant comment about tread wear yet.

"March 03, 2003",4.0,"These tires were purchased to replace the worn-out 205/70/15 Touring T/As on my fullsize wagon. The Touring T/As had impressed me greatly with their overall traction characteristics, but the sidewall was much too soft for a heavy car, and the stock 205mm tread width was of course much too narrow. I debated for many months on what to replace them with, eventually deciding on the Radial T/A as a well-respected performance-oriented tire (i.e. I see a lot of them in Car Craft!). Even on the stock 15x6.5 rims, I noticed a vast improvement in ride comfort and overall dry handling characteristics, and though straight-line traction isnt much of an issue, its become harder to spin the right rear wheel as well. Once I put them on wider 15x8 rims (the 3.75"" backspacing doesnt hurt either except for occasional rubbing), the improvement in handling responsiveness has been phenomenal, and braking and cornering safety is much improved. However, it seems I experience hydroplaning much more easily than with the Touring T/As when they were newer, and snow traction isnt as good as Id like, which seems to speak poorly of the tread design. They also seem to be wearing relatively quickly, and occasional plowing even in dry corners suggests the need for a wider or stickier tire. Overall, Ive been quite satisfied with these tires as a first informed purchase (versus letting a shop slap on whatever they choose), but for my next purchase, I would definitely like to see slightly more dry adhesion and improved performance in wet or snowy weather.

"November 07, 2002",4.0,"Ive owned 3 sets of Radial T/A's, in various sizes, on 2 cars - a '70 Camaro RS and a '70 Chevelle.  They are an overall great compromise between performance and budget, particularly for the musclecar crowd.  This tire's most outstanding characteristic has to be it's wet-weather performance, with relatively little loss of grip on slippery surfaces.  In dry conditions, the dominant trait of the tire is moderate, predictable understeer - with quite a bit of tread squirm and moaning along with it (more so than I've experienced in any other performance tire I've owned).  This tire is definitely not for the enthusiast who desires precise steering response or ultimate grip.  In extended periods of ""flat-out"" driving, Radial T/A's can be expected to quickly but gradually overheat, eventually to the point where lateral grip will decline.

Well, for the most part, just fine. They provide great straight line traction and it is VERY difficult to break them loose. Even on low friction or wet surfaces, it is tough to spin out the rear end either from a standing start, or when trying to induce oversteer. In the snow its a different matter, as packed snow may as well be ice, as the tires struggle to grip. I found the handling adequate, although the steering response could not match my OEM tires, despite their shorter sidewall (50 vs. 65). Cornering was as good as stock, which is probably an indication of the quality of the car's engineering.

"February 07, 2002",4.5,"I do a lot of off roading during the hunting season.  The BFG radial A/T KO are the best off road tire I have owned.  The original equipment tire on my Ranger was Firestone Wilderness AT which were recalled.  I opted to put the BFG's on my Ranger since I had them on my other trucks.  The tread on these tires just last and last.  The side wall's have 3-ply construction so they don't puncture easily.  I blew out two of the Firestone sidewalls before they were recalled!  I also do a lot of driving though canyon paved roads which literally ""eat"" up the tread on other tires from all the twists and turns.  I've tried Gooyear AT/S's, Michelin's, and Big Foot brands, but they don't even compare to the BFG's.  Dollar for dollar these are the best tires your money can buy.

"January 01, 2002",2.5,"I purchased these tires on recommendation, they were wider than the stock tires that come on the S-10 and I was hoping for a bit more grip off the line and in cornering.  I put 265's on the back and 245's on the front.  The rears are more than half worn, if the conditions are anything less than ideal the grip is terrible.

"December 14, 2001",4.5,Have not driven in the snow yet and really have not driven the car that much since it is basicly used as a spare for my GMC truck. Did take about a 500 mile trip since having the tires installed and the ride is super. This car is almost 17 years old and is like brand new with only 90k on the car. I got the car from my mother who purchased a new OLDS and she had bought this car new back in '85.

"October 28, 2001",4.5," Probably the most humble, yet versatile tire available for light trucks. These tires represent an ideal balance between highway manners and off-road traction. You wouldn't want to use them for mud bogging or extreme terrains, but they're sure to leave any standard passenger car tire in the dust when it comes down to trail capability.

"September 23, 2001",4.0," Surprisingly good traction in snow. Thought I would need to purchase more agressive winter tires, but found these work exceptionally well in snow - I drive two mountain passes exceeding 7,000 feet every day going to work. Noisier than I like, but that may be the car's lack of sound deadening material, more than the fault of the tires.

"December 12, 2000",2.5," These tires have exellent dry traction. They are also the best looking tire in that price range, but in all other areas they are pretty typical.I actually lost a little bit of steering feel, compared to the factory rubber, but I contribute that to the increase in size ( 255/70-15 compared to 235/75-15). The BFG's are actually slightly taller and wider, so I don't think that the loss in steering feel is due to the tire design. Next time I'm going to try a 235/70-15 on the front and a 275/60-15 on the rear ",1995 Ford F150 2wd Pick-up ,"25,000 Miles",Mostly On Road,"Fordyce, AR",Spirited

"July 31, 2000",4.0, Excellent difficult to break these tires loose on dry pavement. Traction on slightly wet roads not good especially when moving downhill in a turn. Front-heavy cars like the GN/Monte/GP can experience horrible understeer sometimes losing all front traction.
