On several cars I've owned including my 1967 Shelby GT350, 1970 Mustang Mach I, 1972 Mustang Mach I and current 1970 Mustang Boss 302 and 1967 Mustang GT Convertible you can not beat it for ride quality, road handling, grip wet or dry, treadwear, good looks and value.  It is an all season tire and while I do not take show cars out in the rain, snow or ice, it is incredibly capable in all weather conditions.  As a kid in the 1980s it was the tire of choice and 40 years later it is still the tire of choice.  I hope they make this tire forever!","2":"I have little to no options in this tire size, so not much choice. For an all season or muscle car tire, they do remarkably well with a style a driving more suited for R compounds. Raised white letters are also cool.","3":"The raised white lettering never cleaned up, the blue protective film was hard to get off, even with Tire White.

On 10-24-18, I bought a set for my newly restored 1977 Corvette. I have only driven 2,157 miles on these tires as they shake the car so bad.

This pickup was my wife's daily driver from 1995 to 2000. Additionally, we took it on about 4 long trips, several pulling a loaded car trailer. These tires were stable driving solo at maintained speeds of up to 95, or towing at consistent speeds of 75. I replaced them with the same BFG T\/A radials. Several of the long towing trips were on the second set, including one trip of 500+ miles in the snow towing a motorcycle trailer. During the past 25 years, I have kept my 454SS completely stock, including these tires. At about 120,000 miles, I was not able to get the BFGs and put Toyo ST radials on.  I now have about 167,000 miles on the pickup and will need new tires because the Toyos are over 7 years old.  I will be purchasing the BFG T\/As again. Primarily, because they are correct for my vehicle, but compared to other brands in the 275\/60-15 size, they are the best.  All 5 of my vehicles,pickups, SUV, sports car and street rods all have BFG or Michelin tires on them. After 60 years of driving, it will only be Michelin\/BFG from now on.","10":"All the old people that complain about the white letters being brown, its called \"Bleach White Cleaner\" They sell it at auto zone, advanced, wal mart, etc . Maybe would be worth it to you not to buy the dustiest cheapest brake pads you can buy on discount as well. Spend the extra $20 and get some decent low dust pads. \"Cringe\" ","11":"The BF Goodrich T\/A Radial has stood the test of time as the de facto muscle car, restoration and restomod tire of choice.  On several cars I've owned including my 1967 Shelby GT350, 1970 Mustang Mach I, 1972 Mustang Mach I and current 1970 Mustang Boss 302 and 1967 Mustang GT Convertible you can not beat it for ride quality, road handling, grip wet or dry, treadwear, good looks and value.  It is an all season tire and while I do not take show cars out in the rain, snow or ice, it is incredibly capable in all weather conditions.  As a kid in the 1980s it was the tire of choice and 40 years later it is still the tire of choice.  I hope they make this tire forever!","12":"I have little to no options in this tire size, so not much choice. For an all season or muscle car tire, they do remarkably well with a style a driving more suited for R compounds. Raised white letters are also cool.","13":"The raised white lettering never cleaned up, the blue protective film was hard to get off, even with Tire White.

These rear tires are 21 years old and still look new,including the white lettering. The front tires are 19 years old and still look new,lots of tread left and no cracking anywhere because they were taken care of with tire dressing their entire life.

This is my 6th set of TA's over the span of 25 years, and something is wrong with the RWL quality. I have tried literally every trick in the book, and scrubbed these letters for hours to no avail. Google this issue, and you will see. Unfortunately, they are one of the last players in the game with this classic look.  These tires ended up being the light brown\/yellow raised letter edition.

The original set installed were made in USA. Bought these as they were touted \"made in USA\".  The ones I received are made in Mexico. Guess they moved the factory.","28":"A great classic look tire for 64-72 Muscle Cars. I love this tire and hope it is never discontinued.","29":"I love the style of white lettering, which is why I bought these tires. There were no other white letter tires in my size at the time. Looking back, I should have realised the Raadial T\/A is essentially a muscle car tire, not an all season, all weather tire. Dry performance was outstanding. On a weekend driver in nice weather, I can think of no better tire. On my truck, which is a daily driven light weight 2WD open diff truck, these were not a good option. Wet traction is virtually non existent, which was made worse when the tread is worn. This review is not a slight against the tire at all... They simply weren't designed for what I put them through. So for anyone reading this with a year-round, daily driven vehicle, I'd suggest to keep looking. If you need some rubber for your muscle car, stop looking, you've found the best tire for the job.","30":"Went old school look on my 83 Camaro. Used S\/S Cragers with the Radial T\/A's to get the look I wanted. Running 275\/60\/15 on the rear and 245\/60\/15 on the front. Currently about 100 miles on tires by love the look and feel.","31":"I purchased BF Goodrich Radial R\/A (white raised letters) this month; thanks to the knowledge of my TR advisor was able to get this tire at 215\/70 Front and 225\/70 Rears.  This brand and combination are not available on default based on my car but I insisted to get this brand and vintage look.  The combination works really well and transformed my '64 Corvette convertible which had Tiger Paws (Whitewall) from previous owner.  Those tires may look the era, but the Torq Thrust and BF Goodrich combination looks much better for a driver like myself that prefers performance over looks and driving experience vs authenticity.  To be authentic for this model and year one would need bias ply tires which is something I prefer to remain in the past, thank you.","32":"I have just ordered this set of 4 tires this morning, and as normal the person I spoke with was very knowledgeable and nice. He answered my questions excellent and led me in the right direction for the selection of my tires for my 68 Mustang. My order number is AF17088. My son and I has purchased at least 10 sets of tires from you and every time we have had excellent service. Keep up the great work and especially give the person I talked with this morning a great attaboy and since we have been such a great customer how about considering a discount sometime for me because I am going to have to order another set of tires for my van later this year.","33":"I have been driving for about 40 years and have used Goodrich TA Radials for most of those years.However have also used many other brands.These stand out mostly in my mind for great tread wear,smooth ride(new) and durability.I also like the look of TA Radials on my truck.My truck's stock tires were much smaller and I didn't like the size the factory chose for a truck tire and I decided to change my rims and tires over the years so I now have a wider and taller tire which rides better and wears better.I also no longer need to use ramps to change oil due to the taller tires.Only dis-advantage is the turning radius is wider now.So getting into a parking place I need more room but it's all worth it to me.","34":"radial t-a's the best. been using for 40 years.","35":"I have been running BFG Radial T\/A since 1972.I like them for my style of driving.Doesnt cost as much as Goodyear Eagle and last about 10000 miles longer next close tires is cooper not a bad tire. I have a ramp where 91 west run into 110 north its a 55 mph ramp which I can take with ease at 80 mph. love the tires.","36":"I cannot make too many observations as I have driven only from my mechanics shop to home.","37":"This was my first experience ordering tires online. After research, Tire Rack became the choice for me. I ordered 4 tires for my muscle car and thought I wanted bigger tires on the back to increase the lift.  After mounting the tires, I found that they did not fit so I made a call to Tire Rack.  They sent me two of the same tires as the front and even provided a return UPS number to pick up the original tires at my installer.  After return, they noticed me that my installer had damaged one of the tires around the bead.  After a quick exchange of pictures and conversation, we agreed upon a return price.  Tire Rack is an exceptional company that stands behind their commitment to customer service and satisfaction. I highly recommend them and will be a customer for life.","38":"I waited until I had lots of time and miles on these tire before rating them. Folks that rate tires a week after purchase cannot give a real impression of a tires performance.","39":"These tire are on a 1977 Toyota Celica GT with the wheels from a 1984 Toyota Supra. I am running 225's on the front and 235's on the rear. This car is a long term project and is driven about once per month. I replaced the engine (18RG bored out to 2.2 L, transmission (P51), rear end (Limited Slip), suspension, brakes, cooling system and engine ignition systems. I bought the tires because Bridgestone was the only ones available in 14\" rim size. Back in the 1960's and 70's Bridgstone was one manufacture building excellent performance tires and I am glad they continue this size.","40":"old school great looking RWL tires whereby the performance matches the great look","41":"I only have 100 miles on this tire, I like the performance of the tire. I don't like that the raised white letters have turned brown. Nothing I have used to try and clean them has worked.","42":"Just mounted these tires on my 327 CI 350 HP (Dyno figures) 67 Camaro ( VIN # 000002 first day of production build) with 10,000 documented miles that I obtained at an estate sale 2 years ago.  These tires replaced the original Polyglas F70-14 rubber that  appeared unroadworthy.   I did drive the car for about 10 miles with the old tires and conditions noted were instability over 30MPH, squealing during moderate cornering, car spun 90 degrees under heavy acceleration with non-stop wheel spin despite posi differential.  Enough.  Out with the old and on with the new BFG Radial T\/As .  First test was hard acceleration. Controllable wheelspin for first 40 feet but car went straight as an arrow with no sensation of sideways movement.  Next I took the car through a posted 30 MPH curve at 55MPH and there was no squealing or lateral drift just a feeling of being on rails as I took the curve with a feeling of total control.  Next was 55 MPH straight road with momentary hands off steering wheel.  The car continued straight with no perceptible wandering.  Finally I did a 55 to 0 panic stop.  I modulated the brake pedal to the point of threshold skid however the car stopped straight with no perceptible deviation. ","43":"Have not  driven many miles so far.    no complaints.","44":"superior tire with old school looks, what's not to like?","45":"I just put these on the 76 Stingray yesterday and I'm already amazed.  My old tires were skittering around corners and squealing on off ramps, frequently breaking loose.  The Vette is in great shape and now handles like it should.  Very nice grip in first gear and corners and ramps are solid.  Very quiet at 70 MPH, track nicely on the highway and inspire confidence all around.  Can't comment on wear or weather yet, but for the money I'd be happy with one or two Summers of safe, fairly aggressive driving.  The look is perfect for the 70's classic and the size replicates the original rubber very well.  Speedometer is also spot on.  I was somewhat concerned that this tire was designed so long ago that it might mot perform as well as I wanted.  I read on BFG site that they have made improvements in the technology and manufacture, and I am glad I took the chance.  With so little to choose from in 15\" RWL tires, I'll probably stick with these for the look, value and handling I've seen so far.","46":"Great all-around tire for muscle cars in hard to find 15-inch sizes. They look great with the raised white lettering and have a good balance of traction, comfort, and handling.","47":"Car mostly used for show and highway travel to shows.  Since car is not driven to its limits high speed performance is not known.","48":"These tires are on a corvette i drive ocassionally. the only complaint is the white lettering on the tires has turned brown and wont wash or sand off. the tires handle and wear good for a 15\" tire, even though its getting hard to find them. I may have to flip the tires over to blackwall even though its a hassle to do that....","49":"Customer Service:","50":"Classic cars from the 60s almost always had the bfgs T\/A on them. they are iconic in the car world.....But now cars are faster and to put a set of these on a muscle car seems silly. The speed rating is only 112??? I can reach 120mph in inder 1300 feet. I would like if the company would sell that same tire in a better speed rating!! with a better traction also. I ran the drag t\/a and ate them up within 2 weeks of driving on the street!","51":"Have tires on small truck. I live in the south a lot of rain, this tire is great in the rain. Not a lot of snow here but winter of 14 large storm hit many folks stranded. I was able to get home next day with many detours. I am a professional truck driver wish helped and had loaded about 600 lb. of gravel in bed.  Was very impressed with the tire on packed snow very very slick . Am buying 3rd. set now, love them.","52":"The tires are smooth and quite. The Chevelle handles better with the BF Goodrich tires.","53":"I had to put these tires on my lowered Ranger because they discontinued the Dunlops with RWL and I love RWL. My first complaint is tire noise. These are pretty loud (squealing) when burning out. Other tires I've had were much quieter. But for dry traction, I never had a harder launch at the track then with these. Truck corners amazing on dry pavement with the hammer down. Tread wear is ok, the fronts got choppy because of my negative camber where other brands did not. The rears always wear like they are over inflated even at 20psi! I am running 275\/60r15 which is overkill for the truck, but I could have got more life if they had worn evenly. The fronts are still good at this mileage (different wheel sizes front and rear to accommodate the custom rear end amd lowering kit) I am here to buy new rears as they are at 1\/32 and I spun out in the rain today. prior to that, the braking in  wet weather had been great, but I could predictably spin them when i wanted. I rated the sand performance low because I got stuck pulling out my jet ski on sand and these didn't even try to get traction. A few days ago I climbed a significant hill on gravel and did ok through a muddy dirt road. They are a pretty good all around tire so I'll do two more for now.","54":"I am geting ready to replace a set of P 195\/60\/R15s with a set of P 205\/60\/R15s since Bf Goodrich quit making the 195s. I put them on with 93,165 miles on my old 97 Ford Contour with a front end allignment. The odometer is at 141,000 miles and there is very little tread left. I rotated them every other oil change, aprox 7000 miles. Kept them inflated at 35 psi and have had zero issues in the past 3 years. These are great all season tires and some of them are still made here in the USA, which is a big plus for me. The raised white letter tires also look great!! You can find a cheaper tire but i doubt you will find a better tire. With any tire front end allignmet and the condition of your front suspension is crucial in tire life,people bashing any tire over uneven wear is a problem with the car not the tire.","55":"i had these tires on my ranger and they transformed the truck from a something that i hated driving to something that handled great, rode nice and had almost no tire noise unless i was above 75 mph. they held up to the occasional power braking really well and made the truck fun to drive. there definitely going on my new ranger they were oversize for the truck and soaked up the bumps great. and i even used them to get into a friends camp that was two miles of dirt roads that were unmaintained and even a few small mud holes and i didn't have any problems","56":"Fine on dry roads, but in my Manual 3.0L V6 Ranger I could break them loose everytime unless i took off very slowly. In rain and uphill almost impossible not to spin the tires. I can only imagine how they would do in a performance vehicle. ","57":"I bought a set of raised white letter radial T\/A's for a mint condition 1985 Chevy Celebrity Eurosport that I have owned since 1989. This is only the third set of tires that has ever ben put on this vehicle. These replaced a set of Michelin Pilot HGT4's that I bought in 1999. There was pleny of thread left on them but they were dry rotted from sitting for so long. I have always been a fan of Michelin tires and was hesitant about buying anything else. I wanted a low profile, wide thread width tire. But because this car has factory 14 inch rims on it, the selection of replacement tires is limited. The BF Goodrich radial T\/A's were the only tire I could find in the size I wanted. The Michelin Pilot HGT4's that I had on the car handled nice but always road rough. They seemed to amplify ever bump in the road. The first thing that I noticed after I got the BFG's mounted on the car was how much smoother the ride was. The next thing I noticed was how much better they held going around corners. I can't say how they perform in rain or snow. Because I don't drive this car in the rain or in the snow. There is no issue with me as far as tire road noice. So far I am pleased with these tires and would have no problem with recomending them to some one else.","58":"I have these on my 1969 Mustang Convertible.  Can't speak to the performance in snow or ice, but in other conditions they are fine.  This is a touring\/fun car, not a sports car.  The ride on these tires is quiet and comfortable, which is nice since otherwise the car is pretty noisy due to wind.  Otherwise, some jerk out there wanted these tires and rims badly enough to steal them off the car, so I'm buying another set of the same tire.","59":"I'm in the Junking business haul a tandem R&R old rental trailer 15X5 I've put in it over 2800 pounds and my tire are doing well with weight per tire at 1411 per tire to me that is -------- of good BFG use to Make a traction TA.T witch was way better in wet roads then this it had little s on the tread and it was one -------- of a tire for 80,000 mile per tire got every bit out of them and they had at least 30,000 left on them so i gave them to my poor nabor and he still has them on his car after 2 years of me giving them to them he only drives about 30 miles a week good tires good Foot print on the road","60":"These tires work great on this truck. Quiet, responsive, very good traction, good ride, and I think they look great.","61":"These really work well for this vintage kind of car. They look good, drive well and are quiet. I can't speak to their wet capability because I don't take this car out in the rain or snow. The only drawback is that they flat spot when the car sits for a long time but that is to be expected. The good news is that the flat spots do drive out. For a classic muscle car, I can't think of a better tire.","62":"I had one tire that had to be road forced balanced and I had them all done to be safe.","63":"Best tires I ever had.","64":"I used these tires on my 1968 Camaro RS.  255 60 15 on the back, 235 60 15 on the front.  Rally Wheels. Stock suspension. No rubbing, and they look really good.  I wasn't much of a raised white letter guy, but these really set the car off.","65":"Used this tire on all my classic cars.  Great price for the look and performance.  If you have a late 60's or early 70's muscle car. . .these are the tires to use.","66":"Bought the BF Goodrich Radial T\/A tire for my GMC Sierra 1500 2WD standard cab stepside pickup as a replacement for Goodyear Eagle GT tires that I religiously ran on for many years (only to learn that Goodyear stopped making that tire in a 15\" when it came time to replace them.)  I wanted the White Letter tire and as many of you are finding out, 15\" RWL this is becoming a dying breed.  ","67":"2nd set of these tires and would buy them again","68":"1st time oem tires lasted past 60,000 miles for me. I drive fast and hard but they withstood my daily abuse I put on them. I'm very impressed and surprised daily that I haven't had to change them out yet.","69":"Great Tire tough and classic raised white letters on a scion box gets many compliments. So far 68,000 miles I did not think they would last that long. If tire shimmies check air they are finicky wanting pressure to be even all the way around that always fixed it I had to replace air valve stem one time that was the problem. I rotated every 7,500 miles and had spin balanced and 4 wheel alignment after I  year by toyota dealership. Great look and performance and no I do not work for bf goodrich and they track good made car feel more steady then the oem tires.","70":"No ice or snow driving yet. Performance is good on dry surfaces.","71":"even after completely rebuilding the suspension and power steering up front, i could not get these tires to stop feathering and chopping. they vibrate like nobody's business after countless balance's and rotations. their extremely noisy now since the tread is no longer smooth. now this all could be because i purchased them at walmart... and from what i have herd they are made to a lesser standard so walmart can sell them cheaper. and it also could be because i stuffed them on a 6.5 inch rim, but i like to think their just worthless. and ill be finding out this summer when i get a set of something else in the same size. hello studded snow-tires! they make less noise >.>","72":"Tire is wearing very well BUT This tire is Very noisey and is getting worse as it gets older,  Would NOT buy this again even it it is made by Michlen","73":"Great driving, cornering!  Original tire for my 1970 Chevelle SS. Would never buy any other tire!","74":"I've had these four months and they are much much better than my OEM tires.  Cornering, road holding, noise, wet weather travel are all greatly improved.  Several favourable reviews on this site turned out to be correct. In moderate snow they do reasonably well for an all season but you do have to be careful with them on icy surfaces.  Overall I'm really happy with them so far.","75":"these tires are the only ones left that fit the OEM specs for this car since its 27 yrs old, but I think this is great tire. It looks good and seems to be a tire I would buy again. The price and service from the tire rack cannot be beat anywhere. Great job guys and thanks.  Adam fesperman","76":"I love driving my 88 Z24 5-sp, V-6, and keep it well maintained.  It's cheap.  Can't seem to wear these Radial TA's out. I'm anxious to replace them with better performing tires.  Only bought them because they were the only white-letter tire available for 14-inch wheels, and still are five years after I purchased them.  They hold curves pretty well, but squeal like a pig if pushed.  Wet traction is minimal.  When observing my front tires spinning on the emissions inspection treadmill, I saw one of the tires was out of round, explaining a chronic vibration at cruising speeds.  Going without white letters from now on.  Sorry, BFG.","77":"I am actually a bit surprised by how highly rated on wet traction this tire was on Tirerack. I ran two sets of the BF Goodrich Radial T\/As on my 1988 Mustang 5.0 (everything is stock). It was not until I went with another tire brand on the 3rd set that I saw how awful these tires actually were. I thought all the slipping on wet roads was the way the car was supposed to handle on wet roads. Absolutely not- a decent set of tires was all it needed; and a decent set these tires do not make for this car. I know sometimes for other 87-93 Mustang owners with 15\" wheels this may be the only tire available, but I would rather get another set of wheels than to have to buy this tire again.","78":"Could not be more pleased with this tire. After many, many burnouts, tread still looked new. Excellent response to input, very good cornering behavior. Superb wet weather traction, very good light to medium snow traction as well. Ice performance was so-so, but it's on a 2WD truck that has a Mopar Performance 360 Magnum crate motor in it, so I don't expect a lot.","79":"Iconic tire with very good looks. Good mileage. Amazing wet traction all the way down to the wear indicators. Solid performance. The problem is that these tires had too much runout so the ride comfort was compromised which is a real shame because they were great in every other way.","80":"Great tires, would buy again for my 98 Chevy Tahoe, look great also with 15x8 wheels. I would like to go to a 17 inch tire, but can not located this tire as the same in 17 inch. Thank You Very Much BF Goodrich for a well made tire.","81":"I put 4 years of daily use on these tires, driving in winter and summer. Then went to storing the car in a garage\/back yard for the winters. ","82":"I love this tire for my Nova SS. It's the only tire I will have on this car. The shipping on my tires and rims was beyond belief. I got them in less than 24 hours. Not one company has surpassed that service. I went to 4 tire and wheel outlets in my city and not one place had what I needed. I got on the computer and search for B F Goodrich and American Racing wheels and Tire Rack was the first line in the search. I will definently recommend your company to all. Thank you for fast shipping and having the products in stock.","83":"On third set on 1995 Sonoma with 313,000 miles and love 'em!  Will buy more when these are worn down.  I put the used ones on my car trailer and they work great.  Will also put a set on my 1971 Cutlass S soon.  It has been on BFG T\/A radials since 1977!  Tire Rack prices and service are excellent!","84":"Always liked these tires on older muscle cars - they had good traction even when worn past 70% of tread.  My Benz is lowered 4\" (front and rear) and results in more negative camber which seems to help such a heavy car handle better in cornering.  Any loss of traction with these tires is more related to suspension than the tire.  I have looped my 1971 Olds Cutlass using these tires without even trying on a wet road - but that was due to light rear and lots of torque.  They have excellent dry traction and pretty good wet traction as well. I hope they continue to be available in 14\" and 15\" for the older original rims on these cars. Great tires for the price!","85":"Tires are on a 1966 olds 442 that only goes to shows and cruse nights.They work great on this car it handles great.","86":"Great looking tire good handlin,g highly recommended.","87":"I replaced Goodyear Assurance tires with these BFGoodrich; so my comparison will be between these two tire brands.  The Goodyear's had excellent tread wear.  I put 90,000 miles on them before I had to replace them; but I hated every other aspect about them.  The ride was extremely rough and noisy (they were a higher speed rated tire).  They handled ok on dry surfaces, but was not a problem spinning them at take off.  Get them even just a little bit wet, and hang on.  The wet traction was horrible as was the hydroplaning.  From a standstill, say at a red light on a rainy day, or just tires wet from sprinkler runoff, you could not move the car without the tires spinning.  I'm not talking about opening up the throttle, just pushing the pedal to move the car, it was awful, like being on ice and was especially gut wrenching if you were in the middle of a turn as well.  Was not comfortable with my wife driving the car in wet weather, especially with the kids.  I have had the BFGoodrich Radial T\/A now for about 2,000 miles.  Recently took a road trip to Nebraska and encountered snow and ice.  Same trip I encountered rain as well as dry pavement driving.  The tires performed amazing.  The ride is very smooth (not a very high speed rated tire) and quiet.  They handle great on the ice as well as in the light snow.  On wet pavement I had no problems with traction or hydroplaning.  From a standstill on wet pavement, traction is greatly improved, and spinning occurs only when I open up the throttle a little.  With only so few miles, I cannot really give my opinion on the treadwear.  In my opinion, for my driving style (80 mile daily commute for work and city driving during day) as a spirited driver, I am absolutely happy with the BFGoodrich tires.","88":"I haven't had them in snow yet so can't say about that, though they are good in wet sand at the lake.  Rain doesn't bother me a bit     and I'm satasfied withem","89":"The trans am was the original test car for this tire, so I chose them and the size choices for the 16' rims I can keep my factory look and have the Big fat tire. I keep super stiff coil-over shocks. I run the 285\/60's in the back and 275\/60's front which lifts my GTA, 4\" for the metro driving clearance. These tires take a beating, this firebird is quick and nimble with a 3.90 posi and 4-speed the tires have to be tough. Vin Desiel tough! I drove these tire daily through Ice\/snowstorms,I just put sandbags in the trunks and back seats. I could drive right through 6\" of snow.","90":"Too soon to evaluate the tire performance.  So far nice ride.  Balance was a big issue. 2 tires took over 1 pound (1 almost 2 pounds) of weights to balance.  ","91":"I purchased them in Michigan... if it snows, don't plan a trip out. Now I live in Florida, the wet traction is unbeatable. even if you try to loose control, they want to grab the road. I light my tires up regularly... for fun. and in about 20,000 miles and multiple rotations... I still have about 8\/32 tread depth left.","92":"I recieved this tire when i bought my truck with little remaining tread. as it was winter i put on other tires. after a few months of snow melting i put these tires on. they met my expectations or exceeded for dry traction and far exceeded for cornering ability. as i was used to soft winter tires these were a huge upgrade. however they are the worst thing in the rain and simply dangerous on ice and snow. they may be better if they had more tread but as they are i dont recommend for anything but fair weather driving.","93":"Tirerack prices & service are outstanding and I'll continue to make them my 1st stop for tires\/wheels.  The TA Radials look great and perform just fine in dry weather...unfortunately, wet weather performance is pathetic.  Hydroplane problems with my 68 Camaro @ about 40 MPH or higher on wet pavement (I have new Cont Arms, ball joints, tie rods, idler arm, pitman, new suspension all around, new steering box, wheel alignment (twice), correct tire pressure, etc.).  No emergency or quick braking in wet weather--terrible grip.  Otherwise, it's a great looking tire for a classic car.","94":"Truck is driven .3 m to work ,then short trips as necessary by a seventy year old female.","95":"these tires are great, i have driven 10,000 miles on them.","96":"Love the tire and the price; will be procuring my next set from your company.","97":"Not quite sure of the exact milage...(at least 35,000)  But these tires are at least 8 years old. These tires bridge the gap between performance and driveability. My car has a little spirit to her and these tires have run a 12.4 in the quarter and carried me 20 miles to and back from the track. I drove on these same tires from Raleigh NC to Hollywood Fl and back. These tires have even brought me home through massive ice and snow storms. Now these tires are wearing out and I am shopping for there replacements. The replacements will be BFG radial T\/As. ","98":"Great tire for what it is ,its a sport type tire and not made for comfort but still gets the job done ,and great tread wera so far .","99":"I have had these tires before in the past, I have 0 miles on this set as of 07\/31\/11 due to I'm in process of building both engine\/transmission for it. Should have it running by mid August\/2011.","100":"Have been great tires so far. BFG and Michelin make a great team. Probably one of the best tires for the money.","101":"These tires are an excellent value which offer good performance and ride comfort with low road noise. I have owned this truck for 21 years and these tires seem to be the best I have had so far. They are the fifth set of I have had including the OEM tires.","102":"This is my second set of this very same tire.....both sets being installed on Ford Rangers....one a 1997 and the current set on a 2003.  These raised white letter tires look fantastic on Rangers sized trucks as well as most muscle cars.  I've had outstanding service from them in the past...and currently as well.  You can't go wrong with these tires!","103":"Awful in rain, horrible in snow, hydroplaned twice, on the highway. Speed limit was 70 went 65MPH and lost control.","104":"This is the second set of tires on my 1976 Pontiac Trans Am installed in April.1987 from the Uniroyal PR-6 Tires and what a difference these B.F.Gooderich Euro T\/A \"H\" Tires have made.","105":"These tires are mounted on  show car, The longest drive I took was about 3 hours on the highway, very comfortable ride considering the car is lowered 3\" and has had the suspension stiffened for handling purpouses.","106":"THESE BF GOODRICH TIRES FOR THE MONEY YOU CAN NOT BEAT EM I USE THEM AS MY DAILY HIGHWAY AND CITY DRIVEING THROUGH THE WEEK AND DRAG RACE ON THE WEEK ENDS THEY WILL SMOKE REALLY WELL IN A BURN OUT WHICH I LIKE AND THE HAVE AMAZING TRACTION I GIVE THEM A 10 AND WILL BUY A NEW SET NEXT TIME I NEED TIRES","107":"I do not use these tires in the winter. I use four Winterforce studded snow tires instead. The BFG Radial T\/A are a great summer tire with good wet weather grip which important to me. I would suggest the Wintforce tires for the snow. I live in a hilly area and the studded snows and traction control work great.","108":"I HAVE BEEN RUNNING THIS SAME TYPE AND BRAND SENCE 1983. EVERY THING ELSE; NO NAME OR NAME BRAND TIRE HAS HANDLED TO MY SATISFACTION IN ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS LIKE THE BFG T\/A RADIAL........","109":"I have enjoyed owning these tires on my 1982 Pontiac Firebird (K.I.T.T.) Trans-Am.  The car has the optional 305 cubic inch Crossfire Injection V-8 which has lots of low end torque.  I have been able to hold turns with these tires much better than in any car I have owned - up to 25MPH faster in turns.  Sidewall flex seemed to be fairly minimal on winding back roads.  On wet roads I had good grip and maintained solid responsive steering, even up to 75MPH (I do not support dangerous driving).  Because of the light weight in the rear end of my car, these tires did not provide very good traction in snow or on ice - 120 pounds of sand helped enough to get around.  My next set will be slightly smaller as the 235s rub the front fenders on sharp turns, but overall these are great tires.  K.I.T.T. and I highly recommend them for anyone who appreciates a competent tire.","110":"I experienced loss of control on an ice covered road, now granted I drive a light truck, and this may be an unfair review, but I was traveling on a flat stretch of roadway going 35 to 40 max and lost total control and slid into a fenceline. This was disconcerting, but to a degree, to be expected of a light duty truck empty.","111":"This tire is excellent.  I have replaced them with same size and type since I bought my 93 Ford F-150 .","112":"These tires came on the truck when I bought it (used).  I have nothing but good things to say about this tire.  I have no experience with it in the snow.  However, with the torrential rains we get in FL, I have much experience with very wet road conditions.  Being on a pickup truck, spinning the wheels on wet roads can be very easy, but I find that these tires will really only spin on wet roads if you want them to.  When I got the truck, the tire had about 3\/16s tread left on them.  I thought, 'Well, I'll be replacing them soon'.  But 16 months (and 19000 miles) later and they are still 1\/32 above the wear bar.  Also, even with an inch of more of water on the road, I have never hydroplaned.  I stop and start quickly and tend speed most every I go (sorry, but it's the truth) and I have never had any issues with these tires performing wet or dry.  They are a great value and I highly recommend them.","113":"OEM for 2011 LS Camaro","114":"I'm using these on the rear of my MR2 as they are a better size for the car than the 205s. Unfortunately H rated is not available in this size, but these tires are quite good.","115":"Here in florida sometimes it rains realy hard and I have had other tires that made me feel like I was out of control on a wet road.These BF Goodrich tires have never made me feel unsafe. Even when I am pulling a trailer I know I can stop when I need to,they have very good traction during braking even on a wet road.","116":"Not a bad tire, but has always been noisey and wet stopping not all that good. To expensive for what you don't get.","117":"My last set of B.F. Goodrich tires for my Subaru Outback almost \"never\" wore out. Currently, I have a set of \"long Trail\" B.F. Goodrich tires on the Subaru and they are great.","118":"i take them off in the fall and i will put them back on in the spring so far there are a real go tire, i will be able to tell better this spring when i put them back on and get a few more miles on them.","119":"These tires are not for people whose main concern is gas mileage.  They are for people who want to be able to stop when it's important.  They have great grip.  This Frontier is a Desert Runner.  2WD truck on a 4WD chassis.  We live in Florida where it rains every summer.  The wet traction is exceptional.  The soft ride of these wider 60 series tires is so much better than the OEM tires.  I have had these tires on an Acura as well and the cornering is excellent for tires in this category.  I am going to replace these with another set.","120":"I'll let you know more when we know more.  The Blazer is driven only 2K a year, the tires were replaced as a precaution as they were 11 yrs old.  We don't get much snow here in Florida but I will know about wet traction next spring.","121":"Very disappointing.  The original tires that came with the brand-new vehicle produced 36-38 MPG.  This replacement set was chosen by the Honda dealer after I had reached 55,000 miles on the original tires.  I keep my car in very good running condition, I have not changed my driving style, and I use the same gas as before.  But 1 year later after driving on them for 10,000 miles, I have never achieved more than 31 MPG.  My son urges me to increase the tire pressure from the usual 32 PSI to (perhaps) 36-38 PSI.  This should be dangerous, because the tire documents recommend 44 PSI as maximum.  I doubt that this additional pressure will add more than 2 or 3 MPG.  So the answer is to get rid of these tires and replace them with tires that will give me the previous 36-38 MPG.  With gas prices as they are here in California, the gas savings will pay for the replacement tires quickly.","122":"These are OEM tires.","123":"Tires on Sienna (1 set and will replace with other brand) and Nissan Maxima (on second set) both hard on tires worn out at 30,000 mile (50% city 40 mph and 50% highway 70+ mph) when inflated to recommended pressure and regular alignments.  Out treads wear out quickly even with regular alignments.  On second set of tires on Maxima inflated to 38 to 40 psi the wear is much more even across tire, but very hard ride.  I estimate will get 40,000 miles with the extra psi.  I think the recommended pressures are too low with the increased load upon braking and cornering.  I've had this problem on also on the Michellin Pilot and X-radial, fast with Viva and to a lessor extent on Wal-Mart Douglas (longest lasting but no longer sold).","124":"High quality tire, good performance, good appearance. I like it!","125":"These are my 2nd set of these tires. My 1st set got a little over 50,000 miles before I replaced them. They still had tread left when I sold them. This new set has a little over 10,000 miles on them and they look like new. A good wheel alingment goes a long way!!! Great ride. Nice and quiet, but still have a nice semi-agressive look.I highly recommend these tires.","126":"Bought these tires about 5,000 miles ago and drove on them all summer.  My car has the WS6 performance suspension and a few handling boltons. I push my car a lot out on twisty back roads and I have to say these tires are a definite weak point.  There's lots of sidewall flex and rollover in corners and it feels more like I'm driving a Ford Taurus than a sports car.  Wet traction is poor, which is fun if you like drifting and fishtailing everywhere but pulling out in traffic or merging on onramps can be tricky- I dropped a gear and got these to spin at about 30 mph in the rain while getting onto a highway.  These tires are very soft and did take some of the notorious harshness out of the Trans Am's ride, and they give pretty good traction for the average driver and are a pretty good tire overall.  They also look very 'racy' and get a lot of compliments with the white letters turned out.  I would not recommend these for more aggressive drivers or extremely hard cornering however.","127":"I bought these tires upon the advice of Porter the rep I talked to when I first called looking for tires.Because my SL has been upgraded to 15' rims he thought the 225-60-15s would be a good fit for the car,I had wanted 235s but he said because of the offset they might be too much tire.Well he knew what he was talking about.On hard lock turns they just start to scrub.Not enough to make a mark but just enough to let you know you've maxed out your tire clearance.Pretty cool!                                                          ","128":"This is maybe an ok tire for cars, but not for trucks, like my Ford Ranger it was on. It has very poor fuel efficiency, I was expecting my new AllTerrainTires to decrease the fuel efficiency but was shocked to see my mileage go up by 50 miles per tank with them on! NOTHING changed except my tires. AS for traction goes, great in the rain, handles very nice, nearing the end of their life, but that's b\/c the previous owner(a family member of mine) got lazy with the rotations and balancing but with snow, not the best, far from it actually, on a shoveled driveway with a thin layer of snow... not too pleased when i got stuck, its an awful snow tire deep or thin. Especially on driveways where theres a thin lawyer of snow with slick packed snow on the bottom. I wouldn't buy simply b\/c I go in wet gravel roads, and the winters are tough here, i got stuck in my friends grass one to many times with these tires, if all you are driving on is roads with good pavement and dont go out in bad snow, they should perform nicely. They usually handle excess water quite well but once they start to hydroplane, they don't get the grip back quick. These tires simply dont fit my driving style and the winters  are just too harsh. Most of the time im out driving with the snowplows in the early morning before the roads are clear or driving to clients houses way out in the boonies where i dont know if they're driveway is a swamp, and quite frankly, im sick of asking them to pull me out with their tractors... Tread life could be better in my opinion but has lasted 3 years with 45,ooo  but once again,the rotations were neglected.","129":"I really like this tire. Although they don't have the highest speed rating or most aggressive tread, the Radial TA is a good solid performer.  I first tried them when Goodyear became much more expensive than BF Goodrich. My GN handled predictably, was very solid in hard cornering, and had good traction, even under hard acceleration. I had no problems in the snow & found them to be predictable under all conditions, even towards the end of their service life.  They're a bit more expensive these days, but I think they're just a great tire & look great on classis muscle cars.","130":"Now that I have driven it on slippery and snowy conditions, I found the tire has some imperfections. Still, very reliable on dry and rainy conditions. Good tires for street driving, particularly rough street riding.","131":"Awesome tires for the old school hotrod look.","132":"they were the best tire i ever had on the car i bought the tire when i bought the car and the tires lasted 3 1\/2+ and even then there was still enough tread to pass inspection. in general an awsome tire","133":"I bought these to use as reference tires while I upgraded suspension components on my Camaro. While not a serious performance tire, they did quite well for autocrossing when inflated to 45 psi front. After racing they were then deflated to normal values and driven home with no damage. I use this tire brand on my old muscle cars due to the variety of sizes available for 14 and 15 inch rims, but was suprised how well they perform when pushed very hard. A good value for the money.","134":"This is the only tire available for this classic import muscle car. Overall performance is very acceptable in dry weather. Wet weather driving demands extra caution due to its weird tread design which makes it hard to evacuate water. This is NOT an all-season tire by all means. If you drive with this in snow, you do so at your own risk. The treadwear of 400 tells you that it is good for 3 summers and that's it.","135":"These are the second set of tires I have purchased for my Oldsmobile. I was previously running Sumitomo HTR4 tires and were very impressed by them. Once it became time for the next set, I spent a considerable amount of time in choosing a tire. BFGoodrich was chosen not only because they are an American tire but because of the large amount of muscle car enthusiasts running the tire. I heard many good things about BFGoodrich tires and chose the Radial T\/A. ","136":"This is the only tire available for this classic muscle car. Dry handling is fine and predictable. Hydroplaning resistance is marginal due to its somehow weird tread design. This is really a summer tire by all means. No kidding.","137":"These are great tires if you never have to drive on snow or ice.  I live in the country with a very long driveway and after a snow have trouble getting out of the driveway.  Had Goodyear Wranglers before and could go anywhere within reason.  These tires however quickly lose traction on ice and in snow (more than about 3 inches).  If you live in a city\/town where the streets are kept in descent shape then these tires are ok.  However, if you need to drive in snow deeper than a couple of inches try another tire.","138":"These Tires are very good tires for 4 season and i would recomend them to anyone, Thanks!","139":"OEM tires on my early 2000 Sportage lasted 60,000 miles, after buying the TA's I really began having fun with this little clunker. I pushed through 20\" and more snow with 4 wheel and never got stuck. Did emergency delivery of pharmacuticals all over the state of Maryland. Now I am going to try them on my Chrysler T&C ltd","140":"I'm the original owner of this truck and we have covered 452,000 miles in 20 years.  Tried a few tires but based on good experience with my '64 Corvette, I settled on BFG T\/A's over a decade ago.  On the stock 15 x 8 Rally wheels I get 60-70,000 mile wear, pretty good for a tire you can buy for less than $100.  Sometimes I have several hundred pounds of cargo in the back, they handle it with no problem.  Living at the beach in California I don't get in snow often but they've gotten me through storms when traveling through Vail and Aspen on business.","141":"I have these tires on a 2003 jeep rubicon with 5.25 inches of lift 35 inch BFGs. These are very good tires. The more air you let out the more traction you get. If your axles arent very strong leave a little more pressure so you spin instead of bite and you wont break a axle.( I have upgraded axles) I have climbed rock waterfalls sand hills rock hills and straight boulders. For a 187 each for 35  fifteens. You just cant beat um. You can drop the pressure way down on these and get some serious traction. I go 7 or 8 lbs.( You could go lower if desired) In flat land sand they just float. On highway there fine but I like Mud tires. Mother nature can always TAME a tire but these work well and they look cool too. very good tire better than some that are 75 bucks more each.","142":"HAD A COUPLE INCHES OF SNOW A WEEK AGO. HAD PEOPLE IN PICK-UPS STUCK GOING UP A COUPLE OF HILLS AND I JUST MOTORED RIGHT ON PAST THEM. WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE TRACTION IN SNOW.","143":"These tires were bought for a 1969 Cougar, that sees limited use in the warmer weather. These tires are giving good steering feel and response. Tire wear will have to be seen.","144":"Might be good for a truck but they are terrible on my 280z. Breaks loose way too easily in the wet from acceleration and braking. Can't wait to get rid of them (purchased with car)","145":"i like em  good buy","146":"These tires are the original equipment tires that came on my 2003 F250 Super Duty.  There are more than 8 years old and still can pass state inspection while the truck shows almost 60,000 miles on the odometer!  Great set of tires!","147":"These tires are the original equipment tires that came on my 2003 F250 Super Duty.  There are more than 8 years old and still can pass state inspection while the truck shows almost 60,000 miles on the odometer!  Great set of tires!","148":"I have used these tires before and have been very satified with them. Good traction for a street tire and looks great on a classic car.","149":"Don't have too many miles on this tire yet but they seem to be an excellent tire for all around driving. Great price from tire rack and the bigger size on the Charger looks great. Haven't had them in snow yet but alot of rain and they fell good on the road not too harsh of ride but stick to the road pretty good. Definatly would recomend to a friend.","150":"between 60 and 70 mph lots of viberation. feel every bump and crack in the road. bad choice in tire.","151":"I have had these tires on 3 different cars my sunfire, 94 tbird, and 89 mustang. Had great traction with all cars.  I have been known to heat them up a number of times but whatever I throw at them they keep me going. My set I have now i have about 58000 on and we just had snow and i only have about 2\/32 on them and had no problem driving in the snow.  I just ordered another set of them and will keep getting them as long as i can.   Most other tires i get have great traction the first 10k miles but the way i drive they would loose traction after that.  I kind of hard on my cars but the radial t\/a keep the traction longer.   We had a 4ft snow storm back in '03 and had no problem driving it in.","152":"as of right now i love the tires look great and ride great they stick to the road","153":"These tires came on my 2003 Ford F250 Super Duty.  I do a 5 tire rotation every 3000 miles.  The tires are wearing beautifully... very flat, no erratic wear patterns...Too bad Goodrich changed the tire pattern...they didn't know what they had....I have a 34 foot trailer that I pulled to fl, NY, Va...Wonderful tires. Howard Piotrovsky, NC.","154":"I've had this set of T\/A's on my Chevelle for almost 8 years. I don't do burnouts or jack rabbit take-offs, but these tires are still going strong.","155":"Great tire very low road noise and good traction all at a great price.","156":"thanks tire rack. i ordered a pair of these tires and got them 3 days later. so i ordered another pair of bfg radial t\/a 245 55 18. looks great on 18x7.5\" chrome lincoln 8 spoke wheels off of mkx onto black crown victoria police interceptor w\/chrome package. my chevy travel van has bfg radial t\/a 275 60 15. my gta has bfg comp t\/a 255 50 16. best brand for the money. american cars should ride on american rubber i think, and i'm canadian eh! harryv8 from vancouver.","157":"I drive my Elco like I stole it.  Hard on the throttle and then even harder on the brakes.  I went on a Back to School run up Hwy. 33 in Ventura County CA with a bunch of BMW buddies to show that American cars can keep up with their BMW's and they where blown away how my 86 Elco handled and kept with them every bit of the way.  Didn't get loose at all and went thru the corners like it was on rails.  Although the tread life was less than expected I think it may have some to do with my driving habits rather than the tires themselves.  Great tire, no problems with balance, even tread wear across tire and looks are the TOPS with RWL's facing out of course.","158":"I'm a Driver who pushes the limits, I may not have the car for my style of driving but the these tires make it possible. Corning at high speeds and responsiveness on these tires are at levels of some the best tires out there of light trucks. These tires will dig you out of just about anything thing, and will get loose when asked, the stay on the ground very well unless your putting alot of power to the ground. they hug the road and are a blast to drive with.","159":"After driving 11000 miles all the tires were out of round, and of course would not retain a proper balance.  This caused shaking and vibration in the Monte Carlo at speeds of 55 mph and up. Also the tires were getting louder as time went on.  Only 66% of tread left on the tires after 11K miles!  This is unacceptable and I would not recommend these tires to anyone.  Don't buy these and waste your hard earned money!  After 11K miles, I replaced the BFG's with a set of Mich MXV4's.","160":"This is the third set of tires that I have purchased for my 85 Toyota Celica GTS. The first set of tires were actually the tires that were on my GTS when I purchased it new. The second set of tires were made by the Cooper Tire Company. The Cooper tires were the worst tires (wear-wise)that I have ever purchased. The Cooper's wear out in the center very quickly. I had three blow outs on the Cooper's within 21,000 miles. On the other hand, the BF Goodrich tires that I replaced the Cooper's with now have approximately 29,000 miles and I have not had one problem with the BF Goodrich tires. The Goodrich tires have worn evenly and still have plenty of meat left on them. Great tire!","161":"Optional upgrade size for a 15 year old Mini-Van. Excellent ride, quietness, and stearing feel. As for handling. I just don;t do that in a 15 tear old van. They have my first raised white letters and are American made. Extremely pleased with these tires","162":"Excellent tire for this vehicle.  This is my 3rd set.  I'd definitely buy them again.  I've been getting 27,000 to 30,000 per set.","163":"This tire purchase was to replace a damaged tire on my Corvette. I have had these tires on the car for about 5 years & put about 8K miles on them. They are terrible on the quarter mile. My 74 Stingray has a \"slightly massaged\" 454V8 putting out 500+ hp\/tq to the rear wheels. I would expect these tires to hook up better though, it seems other corvettes in my HP range with other tires hook up better. These tires wash out in corners pretty bad. But I guess that is what you get with these older high profile sidewall tires.","164":"Used on 70 Chevelle SS street strip...is there any other tire that matches the nostalgia and performance?  Who cares....these just look right and all bets are off on treadwear ratings when I light them up and do donuts downtown on saturday nights!   Just kidding!  Tires ain't cheep!","165":"There is only tire company i will ever buy from, BF Goodrich. i have them on my 85 camaro and my truck. The tires perform great and last a long time. the first thing i do when i buy a vehicle is put BF Goodrich tires on, either for street use or off road use they are great.","166":"1963 VW Beetle with modified wheels widened to 6\" (from standard 4\"), otherwise, no modifications to running gear.  I wanted white letter tires, and these seem to have a much higher rating than a similar Goodyear, which rated poorly in wet conditions. ","167":"i have had these tires on about 4 vehicles i have owned over the years. i drive in many different conditions from mud to highway. i have never worried about tire failure with these they are very reliable. most definitly in mud or snowy conditions. about 3 years ago i had a saturn and i always smoked the tires no matter where i went well i had these radial t\/a's on there for about two years. and when it came time for winter i was considering getting some new ones because these were almost bald, but much to my surprise i drove all winter with them and never had one close encounter, i could stop fine and accelerate with no problem and never once got stuck, i always encountered lots of bad weather and road conditions because i live in the middle of nowhere and the roads are poorly maintained, but overall i will continue to purchase these tires for as long as they are available.","168":"I only have a choice of three or four tires for the size I need that have RWL. I always choose these as they're the best appearing and have really good traction for what they are which is a muscle car and light truck tire. If you use them for the wrong application prepare to have unsatisfactory results. Hey, these model tires haven't been around for a hundred years for no reason.","169":"when I told Porter my salesman ,I had plus 1 size chrome Benz wheels(15x7.5) He reccomended the TA s due to size and they were on sale.I bought 4 225x60 15s and have been extremely pleased with the look,handling and the ride.I put them on white letters out and they really make my Gold 380SL look sharp!Shes steady as a rock at cruise speeds,in excess of 100 mph or around town.I LOVE these tires.Cant wait to get some for my 69 and 70 Spitfires.","170":"Only 500 miles so far, but the car drives much better. The old tires served their purpose and did quite well for all-seasons. Everything is sooooo much better with these on the front. I've had BFs before and decided to come back to a tire that I know works well.","171":"In the 440,000 original miles I've put on my work truck, I tried a few different types and brands of tires.  Based on my good experience with Radial T\/As on my 1964 Corvette, I went with 255\/70 x 15s on my 8 1\/2 x 15 stock Rally wheels and have had several sets since.","172":"the BF Goodrich Radial T\/A tires are excellent tires. My current set will need replacing soon, and look forward to a new set of BF G's","173":"These tires are on my restored Challenger, so they'll never see snowy conditions. Also, it's tough to get a real feel for steering responsiveness, the power steering is over powered. But as a final word on these tires, they look great on a classic, they are really quite, traction is fine for the drive style of the car and with the 70 series side wall there's plenty of comfort. I've been an extremely satisfied  customer for over 10 years and will keep on buying these tires for years to come.","174":"Replaced Firestone Affinities.  These have better grip and responsiveness.  A great deal and very happy with improved performance (what little ther is with a Malibu).  Very happy with replacement.","175":"I just changed out these tires off of my Mustang and they are over-rated. They are an average tire but aren't meant for any type of sports car. The tires wear way to fast and offer no high end performance.","176":"I have had this tire on my '81 chevy pick-up for 90000km and they have been an exclent tire right from the get go.","177":"This is a sick Summer tire! Awesome traction on dry and wet roads. The best way to describe it is being glued to the road. The tires also do good in mud, but they ---- in snow and on snowy roads. I drive a GMC Jimmy and with these tires it handles lick a sports car. I can take 30 mph rated corners at 50 with no problems at all. I love these tires and would definately get them again. The larger size fits perfect on the Jimmy and look amazing! i really like the wider stance it gives the vehicle's appearance. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone who wants performance but can't afford spending a ton on tires.","178":"the tires lasted a long long time  cost to high to get","179":"I installed 285\/60\/16's on my Durango. Great tire. At 10000 miles, can hardly see any wear. Dry & wet traction is superb. Cornering is excellent. Balancing was no problem. I reccommend these tires for all.","180":"I usually run 275 50 series but stepped up to the 60 for a taller tire to lower rpms on the. My car is hopped up and runs 12 flat. I use these for daily driving they are GREAT in the rain.","181":"These tires were okay to start with (the vehicle came with these).  They look retro which is cool, but they preform retro as well.  For regular driving they were fine.  For racing they were a bit unpredictable.  They would brake loose with little warning but were genrally easy to recover with.  I found them to be soft riding, but for the type of tire they are, they were a bit on the loud side.   They stood up well to the abuse I put them through.  I switched to a wider firestone tire on the same vehicle.  The firestone was significantly better in every way, on and off the track.  I would not recomend these tires.","182":"Not the best \"performance\" tire on the market but it is hard to argue with their \"good looks\" from a hot-rodders point of view. These tires are a staple, just like flowmaster mufflers when it comes to muscle cars.","183":"Outstanding tire!!!! If you are putting these on a C3 vette you will have to move your E-Brake cables inward to get clearance on the rear.","184":"Very good tire!","185":"we just got through a rough cleveland winter at times there were up to 4in of snow and these tires handled beautifully","186":"THese were the tires that came with my Tempest when purchased; a set of 245\/60R15's in the rear and 215\/60R15's in the front. ","187":"I was running bfgoodrich radial long trails, and they ----ed. i can take coners wi these at fifty, that caused the old ones to squeal and slide at under forty. i cannot get these tires to slip. twist and turns on wet roads at higher than average speeds proved no problem for these. i strongly believe that my jimmy would sooner flip than the tires slide, even on wet roads. i took them through ditches on soaking wet grass up hills, up 90 dergree inclines in two wheel drive. great all around tire. i wll definately buy these again. I have only had these tires for a short time, but i have driven them super hard to get an idea of what they can handle, and what the limtis are. So far, they have been able to hamdle anything i could think to throw at them.","188":"Fabulous tires, I can drive safely in the rain, amazing look , my next set of tires, another Radial T\/A","189":"Excellant tire and service thank you job well done","190":"I love these tires on 2wd trucks they ride good handle good and wet traction is good.  Mud traction is good as well as snow traction.  If you buy them you will be pleased with the bang for your buck.","191":"if you dont drive like me and go through two back tiers a month from burnouts youll love these tiers if you have a nice ride.","192":"This is the 3rd set of these tires I've installed on my truck.  I get approx 29K out of them before replacement, which is not bad for a truck of this weight.  I'll continue buying them as long as Goodrich makes them.  I've also used this same tire on other vehicles and have been extremely satisfied with them in these applications.","193":"All of my friends had used the Radial T\/A's on their muscle cars so I thought I would give them a shot.  Price was also a factor.  I was not disappointed.  For the price, these tires can't be beat.  I have not been able to overdrive them in the twistys and they do well on the straight, although they are no drag radial.  Wet traction is acceptable.  Tread wear is unbelievable.  I have not been nice to these tires but they just won't wear down.","194":"I bought my 03 neon with the BF Goodrich tire size 205\/60 R15. I think these tires are great, I never had any problems with them at all. I REALLY recommend this tire to anyone,I actually bought more of these tires. Hey alittle 43,000 mileson these tires cant beat at all.","195":"These tires are GREAT!!!! I was being stupid the other day and while it was raining I tried to beat a light by were i live and made a right hand turn and with 50% tread I DIDNT SLIDE AT ALL HAD ALL MY TRACTION!!! These are great and i would buy again!!! The off road traction on these is horrible but the fuel econ compaired to others is GREAT!!!","196":"This tire won't quit!  I've put about 80k miles on them and every year I say \"I'm going to have to get new tires soon\" but never have to because they still have tread left on them.  I rotate them every 6,000 miles (every other oil change) and have never had them rebalanced.  They are starting to wobble now at higher speeds, but I will just deal with it until I replace them.  I do a little bit of off-roading a couple of times a year and usually pay for it by getting stuck on wet uphills.  The only issue I have with them is that they have NO traction when accelerating in wet or even slightly snowy conditions.  I have spun them numerous times without even trying to when the road is wet (and numerous times actually trying to spin them too :)  The issue may be with the diameter though since my truck has a lot of torque and tiny 14\" wheels plus it is only 2-wheel drive.  If you primarily drive on dry roads and ROTATE YOUR TIRES REGULARLY then this tire will last forever and be a great performer for you.","197":"I'v Had These Tires for quite awhile. i live in pa were we get lots of snow. just the other night 5\" of snow overnight. these tires get me threw the winter very well. Bfgood riches work wonders with my AWD system. very impressed with control during rain, and light snow. during the summer these tires are excellent during speed and control. i buy these tires for all my vehicles. 1992 subaru loyale,1978 chevrolet Nova, & 1989 subaru XT6. i will buy these tires again. as soon as these ones are done","198":"The BFG Radial T\/A's are great tires.  I currently have 5k on them and I am very satisfied.  I live in Southern California, so I don't have experience with them in the snow.  In dry conditions, the tires grip like -------- and never slip.  These tires have excellent traction in the rain as I have not experienced a hydroplane yet.  The tread is nice and tall so I wouldn't be surprised to get at least 60k in these.  The T\/A's are also great for burnouts; I spin these tires often and they smoke rather easily.  I tend to drive on the spirited side and I will have to say that these tires hang great in the turns.  I've taken several sharp turns in the 40-50-60 mph range and they grip extremely well.  I would definitely recommend these tires to anyone looking for excellent grip and traction in dry\/wet conditions.  I would surely purchase these tires again.","199":"I purchased these tires in the winter, and had no trouble with traction in 6\" snows.  They are quiet and responsive.  I am completely satisfied, and would purchase this tire again.  Probably will use the same tire on my Corvette.","200":"i just wanted to say i have been driving for 30 years and bfgoodrich is the only tire i have ever used and the only tire i WILL ever use thank you for the best tires money can buy keep up the great work thanks again one of your best fans robert gorr","201":"Great Tires! This is the third set I have put on my Grand Cherokee and will be putting a fourth set on in the near future. I only have 232,000 miles on my Jeep and have no complaints with my BFG T\/A's!","202":"best tires I have owned period, long wear, superior traction","203":"I had these tires on my 91 Chevy Lumina and not only did they last over 80,000 miles, they never had problems in deep snow and ice. I always thought it was the car more than anything, but I figured I would buy a set for my new winter\/daily driver. These tires are definately the best all around tire you can get for small-medium sedans. They keep me from having to buy dedicated snow tires. For the price, the wear and all weather qualities make these the best tire Ive used on my daily drivers.","204":"These tires are a good improvement over the continental conti tracs even though I got over 70,000 miles out of those tires. Traction is surprisingly stable in the snow even with this very light truck. They are a little soft in the cornering,but seem to grip well. They get even softer with temps at or near 0 degrees F. A little noisier than the conti tracs, but I am satisfied with what I purchased.","205":"Awesome tire!","206":"I own a 73 Nova that i have put these tires on for the past 5 years running.  And i usually buy 2 sets of rear tires for one set of front tire.... I am not easy on them trust me.  They are the best looking and best priced performance rated tires i can find for my 14\" rims.","207":"Not one complaint. Great Tires, look good wear well.","208":"altho there are better tire out there the BFG radial TA is my long time favorite; I use them on most of my cars","209":"Overall a good tire. My experience has been this tire performs well and has lasted beyond 80k miles. I replaced the OEM tires with these and what a positve change. Wet traction and snow traction is typical of a sport tire. Using 4wd results in tire noise for the following week. I would buy this tire again.","210":"tread still good,dryrotted after nine years","211":"These tires were good when ever I first bought them.  They handle well in the dry, smooth ride. However they were rated for 40,000 miles I have 17,000 on them and they look like racing slicks.  Driving in the rain is like sliding on ice. They are very bad no traction nothing.","212":"I bought these tires for my 85 Grand Prix show car. The car is only used for shows and parades and is stored in the winter. The one time I got caught in the rain I was quite surprised at how these tires really couldnt handle very well on my big Pontiac. But in dry weather, these tires handle like a dream. I would buy them again seeing I dont use the car in the snow or rain. Any one who owns an old muscle car, these tires should be the first choice if applicable for your vehicle.","213":"I BOUGHT THESE TIRES BECAUSE YOU SEE A LOT OF THEM ON OLD CORVETTES, I WILL NEVER","214":"Best tire I have had to date","215":"hello goes very well at a high rate of speed.dont drive my car in the winter.thanks kathy","216":"I had to sacrifice handling for traction control in winter.  I plan to replace these with KDWs in the future.","217":"I havent installed the tires yet.","218":"I have not put any miles on the tires as yet. I have used these tires on my other Corvettes with great success.","219":"In a straight line, these tires are like none other Ive had.  Dry traction is phenominal.  Handling on gravel is a bit dicey.  I pound my car into the ground and these tires have held up to the abuse.  They will not fare very well in adverse conditions such as snow, ice, rain, gravel etc. but on dry pavement, watch out!","220":"These tires are amazing. I took a sharp corner at 60km\/h and the tire didnt even squeel or make a sound. They hug the road like a glove.","221":"These are very good tires.  Last winter I did not even put on the snow tires since the snow was pretty light.  We did get better mileage with the previous Michelins, but they were not good in the snow.  Since we already have the snow tires, I would probably get the Michelins over these, but these are a very good tire.","222":"These tires smoke very well and have good straight line traction","223":"i recommend these tires. i never got stuck in snow. never slid on snow covered roads. i plowed right through snow with these tires. i am buying a set for my wifes car now. best tires i ever had.","224":"This is a great tire, I first bought the tire for looks with the raised white letter. After 28,761 miles Ive only used 4-32nds of tread. I do rotate ever 6,000 miles and have the alignment checked and corrected and I keep 35 psi in the tires. So far so good they are very quiet and handle very well. I dont do mucch hauling with my truck but when I have they were great. I will,with out a doubt by these tires again.","225":"I purchased these tires for my modified Trans Am (modified to resemble K.I.T.T.) and have larger widths in the rear than the front so please forgive the numbers from the initial page as I cannot recall them off the top of my head.","226":"Rolling resistance seems higher than my previous (Cooper) tires.  Gas mileage is about 8% poorer with BFG.  Road noise is appreciably higher than the Cooper tires.","227":"I bought the BFG Radial TAs For my wifes malibu she loveas the tires and so do I  Im looking forword to getting them for my truck soon","228":"Worst tires Ive ever seen! After 27,000 miles they are ready for the trash.You should not have to spend 500.00 on another set of tires when your car is only a year old!","229":"These tires became hard plastic after 1 year only. The car slides on ICE and Light snow and heavy snow as if it is on Ice Skates. Today I almost died when the car spun around on me ON DRY ICE FREE PAVEMENT as I was making a left turn to get into a ramp leading to the freeway. I would not recommend these Tires one bit. I have the BFGoodrich Traction T\/A on my Honda Accord and they are outstanding, everything that these Radial TA tires are not. Worst tires I have ever used.","230":"I have mounted these tires on a Classic Mustang Convertible -67 and only drive during the summer.","231":"This is my second set.  My only complaint is treadwear.  I currently have 15K on this set and based on the current tread depth, I estimate Ill get another 10K to 15K.  Other than that, the tire is great.  Good value for the $.","232":"Its a 2wd Ranger, warmed over 4.0l with a 5-speed and 3.55 posi rear. I wailed on these tires for 30,000 miles after they were on my wifes 300 hp Cougar XR7 for 20,000 miles. They wear excellent, quiet, awesome dry and wet traction. This truck has also had 255\/50 17 G-Force T\/As, would recommend BFGs to anyone. Great tires!","233":"These tires look great on my conversion van complimented by white wagon wheels. They are are good all around street tires but their appearance is the best feature.","234":"Never had a problem with the Goodrich Radial T\/A","235":"When I got the car, it had Michelins on it and the car didnt ride very well. If you took the car around a corner to fast you could feel it sliping some. When it came time to get new tires I was looking for something cheap, since I am a student. These tires came in the lowest price. When I mounted them on my rims, the car handled so much better, No more slipping in the corners.","236":"I used to get stuck in backyards with the old wilderness tires from Firestone. Now I dont get stuck anymore. I dont spin my tires at redlights in the rain. And big puddles on the freeway are not a problem any more. I used to have to \"plug\" holes in tires all the time. I havnt had a flat tire with these yet. Even though I drive in and around the work site. Loveem","237":"I drive alot of in town,gravel,highway miles everyday. Depending on my mood and how quick i need to get somewhere i take gravel and they hold great. If i decide to race at a red light,they launch good but slide just a little.Overall they hug the road for what i put on them.","238":"When I was searching for the best tires for my classic car, everything I read and everyone I spoke to said these were the tires to buy, so I did.  They have a great look and ride smooth and quiet.  Even after 8 years and 11,000 miles, every year people ask me if I just put new tires on my car.  They still look brand new.","239":"nice tire ..good tire life","240":"Having used the G-Force and Comp T\/As on my other vehicles, I purchased the Radial T\/A for my daily driver Ranger pickup. As usual, bfg doesnt diappoint. Theyre grippy tires but are a little noisey like the old comp t\/as. Its nice that BFG can make a regular tire for a regular vehicle thats affordable, and still better than the competition.","241":"I realize that the scores I have given this tire may seem a little extreme. However, I have never had as good of an experience with any other purchase. I am what most would consider a very aggressive driver. Not only do I enjoy it in my spare time, but it is my job. I put these tires on my monte carlo over eight years ago, and believe it or not they still have more than enough tread to be legal after over eighty-thousand miles. I highly recommend anyone to at least try them out if you get the chance. You wont regret it.","242":"These tires on my V8 powered 2wd Dakota dont agree with my right foot too much, unless Im doing a burnout. Dry traction isnt great but isnt bad either. Wet traction is a challenge but far from unsafe. The only thing that would keep me from buying the tires again would be the tire wear, or lack of it. With only 22,000 miles on them they have worn past the wear bars. The tires would be much better on a lesser powered car or truck with a driver that has a lighter right foot.","243":"Bought T\/A Radials to replace stock equipment General XP2000.  Superior tire in all aspects.  Will buy again.","244":"Replaced Goodyear Eagle ST with the Radial T\/A.  Great tire with awesome wet traction.  The agressive looks are a plus on this classic Chevy.","245":"If you are looking for a comfortable ride tire this is the one for you. This tire has excellent road noise and had decent response.  I would recommend these to anyone with older vehicles that need an improved ride.","246":"ive had these tires for about 1000 miles and ive smoked them a lot! (gotta show off) and they seem to be holding up great!","247":"i have been using bfg radials for the past 15 years they are a great all around tire for all seasons and they dont break the bank either","248":"I recently replaced the Firestone tires on my 2001 Civic EX coupe and the change was amazing! These tires are made for the car. If your in the market for new tires for a Civic coupe, you cant go wrong with these. They are a must buy!","249":"I beat the crap of these tires for 50k. The are starting to separate and the tread is dry. Snow, Mud, Dirt and Street they performed well. %9k hard driver 70k mild driver.","250":"Best value for the $.  A good all round tire for daily driving.  Fair traction on hard acceleration, very predictable on a road course.","251":"i really like this tire. its very quiet on the highway compared to the road huggers i used to have.  u can expect anytire to not break free in gravel unless itsan all terrain or off road tire. even then, they are still going to spin in gravel. i drive mostly on dry roads and the traction is great. i also drive on a lot of gravel roads and up steep hills. with only 2wd i am limited to where i can go. but with there tires i was able to go up steeper inclines without wheel spin. and they ride very smooth. im very satisfied with them","252":"My review is as a conservative safe driver.  I drive mainly at speeds of 65 to 72 mph and try to avoid hard braking.  However, these tires come through for me if I must stop suddenly.  The tires are very quiet on my Cavalier car and passengers comment on its smooth ride.  Handling is very good.  I may not be so demanding of tires so long as they hold up.  And this tire holds up.  I have owned 4 sets of BF Goodrick T\/A and have never, I repeat, never had a flat.  Got a nail stuck in one-one time but it didnt go flat.  The warranty covered the repair.  The set of T\/A tires Im running right now have at least 66,000 miles on them--and guess what, except for the corners, the tires look like they have only about half that many miles on them!  The funny things this time with this set of tires is Ive only had them rotated two times.  Im about to go get another set.  I dont drive crazy in rain and I slow down to about 35 or 40 mph in snow but they get me to where I am going.  I keep my wheels aligned and I adjust my driving for weather conditions.  You cant expect any tire to be totally safe in ice\/snow and hard rain.  The driver has to give the tires a break.  Hope this review helps you in some way.--Mike Baggett","253":"I use this tire on my stock rims for my winter tires, I love them, my car came with goodyears stock and I hated every mile I dorve on them untill they prematurly wore out 15,000 miles after I bought my car. these tires feel great up until the higher speeds and then have a slight float, nothing that cant be delt with. I will always run these tires come winter rime as long as I have my corolla","254":"Cost to much","255":"I dont like the way they drive on very wet roads. They arent lasting as long as they should especially considering I have rotated, and maintained air pressure etc.","256":"Ive run Radial T\/As for almost 15 years, Ive NEVER had problem with performance, milage, etc. They still look as good now w\/the RWL as they did the first time I ever put a set on my car. A musy buy!","257":"Treadwear is exceptional 75K on them and still have 3-5K to go. Wet traction is fair.  Prone to punctures, had 7 so far. Good thing I could fix them myself, would have cost $$$. Looking at another set of BFG.  Considered Yokohama Avid ST, but after looking at the reviews I change my mind. People have reported quick treadwear and need of a replacement after 30,000. Not for me Id be buying tires next year. Ill stick to BFG.","258":"ok i have 2 thunderbird sports my newest is a 91 and it has 46,000 original miles on it. it handles like a mustang with these tires on it. scince the cars are rear wheel drive and these tires wear out fast on the rear i run a dunlop gt qualifier on the back. i just started this combo but so far so good ... definately a good choice for the front but can get expensive for the back if you are a lead foot.","259":"These BF Goodrich Radial T\/A tires are excellent on dry traction!! They also have great cornering stability and steering responsiveness too. I put a set of them on my Grand Am last year, and so far after 16,000 miles Im still very pleased with the performance they give to my car.{not to mention they look really sharp} I will definitely","260":"When I first started driving years ago, I thought a tire was a tire. But since then I have purchased a number of different tire brands and so far BF Goodrich is THE BEST! I am actually getting ready to purchase another set of wheels to go on my truck and i would not put anything but BF Goodrich on it. Excellent quality!!!!","261":"these tires have been very good to me except on the snow covered ice.  they withhold my fast cornering and last minute braking.  I would recomend this tire for as person who mainly drives their vehicial in the summer or light snow.  I have drivin over 15000 miles on these tires and they will go for at least 15000 more.  I made a good move when I bought them.","262":"For the cost it was the best buy out there,  Ive always liked Mechilins and seeing BFG are made by Mechilin, I tryed then and they ride like equal priced mechilins, but with the retro style of the raised white lettering and tread of BFGs","263":"Nice smooth ride-fantastic look against my black  Imperial-1981","264":"Ive used the BFG Radial T\/A tires on my Tahoe for about 200k miles.  These tires can be good or really lousy - its all a throw of the dice.  I always buy 4 tires at a time.  Ive had 1 set that were perfect.  Ive had one set that 3 of the tires had to be replaced due to not being able to be balanced.  Ive had problems with these tires holding a balance.  Ive always had to go back multiple times to get the tires re-balanced right after purchase.  Theyd be balanced, ride okay - a week later theyd be bouncing all over the place.  Some sets would finally balance out, some wouldnt.  My current set never balanced out but BFG has gotten much more strict on what they consider to be a defective tire.  Even though Ive had this set, (like every set) rotated every 5k, Ive never had a good ride out of this set of tires even though Ive had them re-balanced with every rotation.  The tires last anywhere from 30k to 45k - Ive always driven \"spirited\" but the tire wear varies greatly.  Ive found that every set of tires changed to a much poorer level of operation at about 20K to 25k miles.  Overall ... Ive had 5 sets of BFG Radial T\/As on my Tahoe, Ive been totally happy once, middle of the road happy twice, somewhat unhappy once and really unhappy once.  I will not purchase another set of these tires again.  Ive been looking at a lot fo reviews and for a Tahoe\/Yukon, the best reviews for the size tire I want (255\/70R15) Ive decided that my next set, which I need to get now, will be the Firestone Destination LE tires.","265":"I had Bridgestones and they wore out in less than 30K miles.  The T\/As are much better all around.  Ive made two 700 mile Interstate trips and driven in one snow storm.  The T\/As are quieter and handle better on my Suburban than either the Firestones or the Bridgestones I had previously.  This makes my 5th set of T\/As on trucks, SUVs and vans I have and I couldnt be happier.","266":"Very nice, good weather tire. Very sporty appearance on my conversion van. Tire is available in many hard to find sizes with white letters.","267":"This is the second set of these tires on my Maxima. I was reasonably happy with the first set but treadwear was only average, not as impressive as the Radial TA\/kos on my truck. After the first light snow of the season the first set couldt pull us up a hill so I had them replaced. ","268":"If I didnt feel these tires were worth a 10 I wouldnt have bought them. The Goodrich Radial T\/A is a great tire I have been using them for years on my other cars","269":"I bought these to replace the original Uniroyals and was told by several \"car guys\" that they wouldnt wear well.  Boy were they wrong, I have 35K miles on these puppies and they still have 1\/2 their tread left.  I highly recommend these tires for lighter vehicles.","270":"Tires had great traction during winter until this year.  Have spun out quite a few times with the first few snowstorms and tires just spin when starting from a complete stop with any snow on the road.  Tires still have enough tread but time for new tires.  Probably will get different kind next time.","271":"Wouldnt be afraid to go another 8K in summer driving conditions.  Pricing is exceptional when you take the amount of mileage driven into consideration.","272":"Tires came on my truck and are just horrible in the rain. The wet traction is horrible and downright dangerous. Tires spin on take-off if road is the least bit wet and I have a 4 cylinder. Horrible, horrible wet weather traction. Have not put braking to the test in wet conditions as I drive very slow and give cars ahead of me plenty of room. These are so bad in rainy weather that we take my wifes car if possible when it rains. Will be coming off and replaced very soon. They get worse wet weather traction as they wear, also.","273":"Bought my truck used with 25,000 miles - with Firestones that were bald.  Bought the T\/A set thinking, if they were good enough for the Bandit, theyre good enough me me!  With 10,000 on the tires, I had to make an emergency slam on the brakes, wet pavement, 40 mph stop, with a passenger who drives a Porsche.  After we both took a deep breath, he said, \"Oh my gawd, what tires do you have on this this thing?\"  ","274":"THESE TIRES ----. FOR A 50000 MILE TIRE YOU WOULD THINK YOU COULD COULD GET AT LIEST 35000 TO 40000 MILES.I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH MICHELIN.","275":"Radial t\/as are the best bang for the buck. I dog my s-10 and these tires never let me down. I wont even consider another tire for my s-10.","276":"These tires really last a long time, other than that, they arent anything special. There are much better tires out there for less. They ride  loud and pretty stiff too. My kumho touring 732s put these tires to shame.","277":"I have these tires on my 1975 corvette. They are 15 years old. I smoked the tires numerous amount of times(150 plus feet and more of tire burning patches). I still have the little nobs between the rubber. The tires are like brand new. If you dont believe me I can e-mail you a picture of the tires. These tire should be in the hall of fame! Bob","278":"Purchased another two set for my brothers F-150 in 295\/50\/15 awesome tires and another mustang of mine","279":"These were the OEM tires on my wifes Outback Sport.  Other cars are a Nissan Sentra SE-R with summer and snow tires, and a Toyota MR2 with summer tires.  These BFGoodrichs still have some tread left, but they no longer have good rain traction and are starting to dry rot.  The car is actually pretty fun to drive in the dry, and when the tires had less than 35k miles, they were excellent in rain and snow (would rate them a \"7\" new, but \"4\" now).  For the price, decent snow\/rain traction, high treadwear, and relatively high fun-to-drive factor in the dry, we will by buying another set.","280":"This is an excellant tire and will continue to use it.","281":"Second pair of Radials Ive had from BF and they were good tires.  My first pair, I put 97,000 miles on with no problems.  Mostly highway these tires held up great.  Even the last pair I had I beat the heck out of and they lasted as long as they should have.  I recommend them for street use, but would shy away if you have an SUV.","282":"We have been getting rain this whole week in NY. I put thses tires on my 86 Turbo Coupe and man they are great. It handles alot better then any other tire I have ever bought. Driving in the rain feels like driving on a dry road.","283":"T\/AS ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST WINTER TRACTION ON MY","284":"T\/AS ALWAYS GIVE THE BEST WINTER TRACTION ON MY","285":"I bought a set of these on my friends recommendation whos said BFGs \"wear like iron\". Turns out this is an average tire at best. They are very bad in the rain. I can spin the tires without even trying and my Ranger has an underpowered 4 cylinder. One tire is also leaking although this could be attributed to Michigans pitiful roads.","286":"my old camaro just had way  to much power for these tires.  i managed to burn off a set in about a week and a half.  of course three trips to the drag strip didnt help.  but other than not \"hooking\" off the line i really liked them and would pobably spring for a new set if i still owned the car.","287":"I actually have B F Goodrich Primera tires and they arent listed on the sheet.","288":"i drive harder than there is a category for. i love these tires for my 1992 t-bird sport. it has a 5.0h.o and i kill these tires with in 10,000 miles they handle well and look even better. others could get better treadwear than me but i have more fun than them too.","289":"bfg radial ta is a good tire but cant keep up with huge sway bars and stiff springs. my Trans Ams weak point in corners are the tires but i will say they held up good enough through the twistys to stay in front of a c5 vette. i know that pontiac engines were known for there low end torque but i am running 8:1 compression and cannot hook up until after 35mph tire is good for cruising not running hard","290":"I purchased these tires in May of 2005 to replace the factory BF Goodrich Radial T\/A ones I had on my 99 Explorer (Eddie Bauer). I went with the Yokohamas after reading the reviews here on Tire Rack. All I can say is WOW! What a difference! Before, there was so much noise and vibration I thought I was riding over metal grates. Once I put the Yokos on, noise has dropped considerably, handling is better, and cornering and steering are also much improved. I definitely would recommend these tires!","291":"good tires for my daughters use, wont be used in snow or cold weather.","292":"I have 25.000 miles and still have 40% tread. every 3,000 miles with oil change tires get balance and rotated. aligement every other year and have new struts and shocks.(monroe)works for me.if the car set a day or two they have a flat spot. the shimmey in the front will go away with lower air presure. love my T\/A.","293":"THESE TIRES KICK BUTT! Im upset that BFG discontinued my size, 2655015.  They look great! They handle incredible! Speeding taking the corners in these tires made my truck feel like my sportscar!","294":"these tires have tendency to shimmy in the front end, they need to be rebalanced a lot, they are horrendus in winter or rainy conditions, they are ok on the highway because they are smooth but they seem to develop flat spots over night, they handle ok on dry cornering. Might be a good tire if you drive on the highway and live in the desert.","295":"Have been experiencing a shimmy in the front end of my truck.  The truck seems to jump to the right when you go over a normal bump.  Had front end checked nothing found.  Having difficult time with dealer in replacing tires.  Got the run around and sent back to the auto dealer.  I am not very happy with the service and the product.  Has anyone else experience this skipping problem with these tires..  Please post if you have.","296":"i still have some tread on my tires and they dont look 2 bad except they are showing cracks on the sides","297":"The car is actually a Chevelle, but thats not listed.  These tires seem to hold up to the power of a 454 okay, and theyre cheap enough to burn em once in a while, which is easy.  They last a LONG time and resist rot pretty good.","298":"Love these tires, hope they never go out of business!","299":"waiting on wheels","300":"These tires were made popular by movies and the fact they come in odd sizes. Maybe its just the vehicle I have them on but I can never get traction with them! They also wore right down the middle even though they werent ever over inflated. They also smell awfull when you peel out. Which is all the time due to lack of traction. I could never drive in winter with them even if we had 1 inch or 1 foot of snow. I wish more companies would make raised white letter tires in odd sizes instead of just the handful that are out now.","301":"BFG Radials are one of the best tires out there. I have been using these on my cavy since i bought it at 16, bout 5 years ago, and they are just so solid. i beat the crap out of them, i drive them extremely hard, and they just ask for more. treadwear could be a bit better, but i smoke them off about 8 times a day, so i guess i cant complain.","302":"I have these tires on my 1937 streetrod so they really dont see any snow traffic but I have used the Radial T\/A on my other cars and they are superb in snow.","303":"Ive had the car for 10years... This tire is absolutely perfect for my driving style. I bought one set about 5 years ago and never looked back. I also have them on my t-bird and love them...","304":"These tires are Great!  I saw a set way back when, thought the tread design looked stupid, so I never tried them.  I finally tried a set (I Love BFGs) and they are by far the best tire Ive put on my poor truck.  I still have it confused with a Firebird, so it gets driven HARD.  The tires are never the weak link in handling\/braking...  Ive yet to loose grip (cept intentionally)  Awesome Product!","305":"3-29-05 As Past I Purchased 3 Sets (4) 1st Ran Earliest Version On My 1979 Dodge Street Van, B250,Outer Edges Wore Bad- But Warranty---BFG Replaced 2nd Version-OK!","306":"27000 miles on these tires and theyre within weeks of needing replacement (most wear bars are even with tread).  Tire wear and pattern is pretty much even.  If the road is wet, its difficult to pull out into traffic without spinning the front wheels (Focus SE with manual transmission).  Dry performance is quick and stable.","307":"Looked at all types of tires,choose the TAs to make a trip from Alaska to Galv. Texas, then stay on the car for the next 3 yrs as a students car. The tires  performed great,in all weather and road conditions, snow,ice, rain,dry,muddy,pavement and dirt roads I was very impressed...","308":"I must confess that in advance that I may be bitter because the tire shop put these on my Cavalier instead of the (far superior) Traction T\/As.  Ive had them on for a couple of months and so far Ive driven in snow\/slush\/ice\/wet pavement\/dry pavement and I have not been very pleased with them.  Although they seem better in the snow\/slush than the tires they replaced (\"Dean Stingers\"), my old tires only had 2-3\/32\" of tread left and were about the cheapest tire you can buy.  Grip in all conditions is mediocre at best.  Dry grip is good enough for my relatively underpowered car, but wet\/snow\/ice traction is poor.  Ride quality and noise are not bad.  I cant comment about tread wear yet.  If you are looking for a performance upgrade, look elsewere; there are much better all-seasons out there for around the same price.","309":"this tire came with the manufactures tires","310":"I have 255s on the rear and 235s on the front.. Probably one of the best cruising tires I have ever had but also when you wanna get up and go they have the grip to put the 350s power to the road","311":"Overall a good tire good handling and adequate traction in Michigan Winters.  Seems to wear quickly but used mostly in City which leads to quicker wear.  Good tire for the money also great looking tire.","312":"They dont hold up long on the ranger, has a light back end, not sure what tires would hold up.  But boy oh boy, does that rear end like to hop, even when I try to hold her down so she doesnt hop, oh well, good deal on them, and for a college student, thats all we want.","313":"These tires are very good performance tires and have excelent traction. I have 295\/50 on rear and 235\/60 on fron.  They do wander a little because they are so wide. But I love them for their traction and cool hotrod looks.","314":"Excellent in snow.Fair on ice. good wear previous tires were long trail t\/a. These are much better.a little pricey. will buy again.","315":"79 Cutlass Supreme; 350CID 300Hp, Suspension built for handling (in progress).  Great tires on the stock Olds 14\" Rally Wheels.  Its easy to break the wheels loose in dry weather, but awesome in the rain!  No hydroplaning even at normal highway speeds in light rain.  Nice and quiet.  Cant really comment on treadwear (too many burnouts :) ) or comfort (stiff springs & shocks).  Great tires for old classic American Iron, especially with the white letters out.  Once the suspension work is complete, Ill go with Radial TAs 225\/60 up front and 255\/60 in the rear.","316":"I have 4 cars now running on BFGs now and have always been happy with the service life I have received!","317":"These Tires are good all around, except for wet traction. They are dangerously slick when the roads are wet. I do drive a Ford Ranger pickup, which has very little weight on the back, but I never had this problem with the old Firestones. Treadwear is decent, especially considering all the spinning that goes on in wet weather.","318":"Second set on the van, put 60k on last set. kept inflation up a bit to 35 and we love it. Going to put same on my pickup.","319":"This is my second set of these tires.  Yes, Id definitely purchase them again.","320":"These are good tires, I would definatly buy them again.  The tread wear is great.  There not the best in the snow but that also makes it fun. They resist punctures and cuts well too.","321":"cars actually a Chevelle; 425hp\/450ftlbs engine with 4.10 rear gears; Yokohamas are 295\/50\/15s in back and 235\/60\/15s in front.  car is far better in every way with the Yokohamas vs the BFGs.  Pricing was awesome.  Im sure there are better tires, but not for this poor mans budget.","322":"ice traction not so good.... thats what i love about these tires... perfect for my \"Drift-Style\" Driving around the corners and straightaways, summer traction is top of the line quick gripping non skipping perfect for drag, a little touchy if youre trying to slide around those corners, great for high speed highway-dips.","323":"Replaced OEM Mich LTX @78000mi w\/BFG Radial TA. Small bits of the T\/As tread chipped off on rocky roads. Chips got so bad by 22000mi had to replace tires. Went back to the LTXs and now have 30000 on them with no visable wear.","324":"this is a great tire for an older car, it has that look that says musclecar. great tire, handles well, does everything well. these tires create big billowy clouds of smoke when you melt em down","325":"I have in excess of 80,000 miles on my 99 Toyota Tacoma, all on aset of Radial TAs. I have read several reviews on this board where the main problem was excessive tread wear. Of course I did not have that problem. I am planning on getting me a set of these same tires for christmas and I hope I will have the same good fortune as I had with the previous set.","326":"I recently bought these tires for my Grand National and love the way they look and drive. I have always liked these tires on older muscle cars, as they have a nice aggresive look to them, but what I really like about them is they have plenty of traction. My previous tires would spin on dry pavement at 40 mph when I got on it, these dont. I would highly recommend them.","327":"These tires are difficult to let loose in dry weather. However in the rain, the rear tires let loose at almost every turn. The sidewalls are not stiff so they bounce around in turns. THEY EVEN FLEX WHEN I CLOSE THE DOOR! The tire wear is excellent. I am about to downgrade to a tire of lesser width just so I can get a different brand with better wet weather performance and stiffer sidewalls. This brand is one of the few available in 215\/60\/14. I would rather get 195\/60\/14 to get a larger selection of tires.","328":"warranty package wasnt included with the tires when they were delivered.","329":"Sold truck","330":"Love these tires.  They look great and handle great.  I have had many different tires and I am very happy with these.  This is a rear wheel drive car, driven in Minnesota, gets around no problem!!","331":"Have been buying these same tires since 85. Cant believe that the price hasnt changed in all those years. They are definately the classic muscle car tire. Ive bought at least 6 sets of these and could decent milage out of them if it werent for all the stupid things Ive done to them. They are the old reliables & Id recommend them highly!","332":"THESE TIRES ARE GRAET FOR THE EVERYDAY DRIVER WHO DOESNT WHAT ANY KIND OF PERFORMANCE FROM YOUR TIRES. THE SIDE WALL IS SO SOFT WHEN YOU TURN QUIKE THEY GIVE A FALSE FEEL THAT YOUR SLIDE BUT REALLY THE SIDE WALL IS JUST GIVING AND THE TIRE IS ABOUT TO POP OFF THE RIM. ANOTHER THING IS THEY HAVE NO WET OR DRY TRACTION EVEN WHEN THEY ARE WARMED UP. THEY HYDROPLANE LIKE YOU WOULDNT BELIEVE SO IF YOU BUY A SET WATCH OUT.","333":"Not a bad tire, wear isnt bad but ive had much better.","334":"I love the white letter look, they are really sticky tires for the money and i love them, the one problem i have with them is that i am a driver with a heavy foot and they show because they wear really fast","335":"A significant upgrade for this car that came with 205\/75-15 rim protectors as OEM.  Went to the 235 which is the patrol car size and transformed this boat that has a standard suspension.  Everything improved over the OEM in every respect, illustrating the benefits of the size upgrade perfectly.  Plus the 235 fills the wheel wells nicely and got the rear end up a little, lessening the tendency to drag out of even moderately inclined driveways.  Never has hydro-planed yet though down to about 5\/32\" currently.  Very quiet until recently when a worn idler arm allowed an out of line condition to feather the outer blocks.  Steering response and handling with the T\/As are good while ride is excellent.  Great looking tire, well priced, decent wear.  Car is used for high speed 70-80+ mph highway driving and the tires do great, dont give up too soon on the two lanes either.","336":"COULD HAVE GOTTON ANOTHER 10,000 BUT WITH WET WEATHER NEEDED TO CHANGE. HAVE DECIDED TO TRY THR GEOLANDER HT\/S.WERE THE BEST TIRES YET THAT I HAV OWNED ANND GOTTEN MORE THAN 20,000 THE WAY I DRIVE","337":"My 3rd set of T\/As on this highway driven truck. I pushed the last set of tires over 80,000 miles.","338":"This size tire has the best dry traction Ive ever tried, Be carefull in the rain though!! This is an awesome summer tire hands down","339":"The tire has lasted a long time and seems to have held up well, My only doubt is the poor conditions: not happy with traction in snow and only average in rain.  Ill probably look around carefully for better quality verses price before rushing off to buy these again.","340":"Great handling, traction, confort, look. I will probably buy again.","341":"Excellent traction except snowy condition but as far as tread wear if you want long lasting you better go with something else. I have about 30,000 miles on mine and there is absolutely no tread left.","342":"The tires I purchased is for a car I am currently restoring, and have only driven on them about a 1,000 miles so far. They seem great. The purchase and delivery was easy, and Im sure I will try it again at some point in the future!","343":"Cant beat the tire or the way it looks on my sport truck.  Buying my fourth set of BF Goodrich tires tommorow.","344":"Best tires I have ever had on a lowered vehicle. They perform as well on dry pavement as the same size of Michelins (which are a lot more expensive)I have these tires on 3 vehicles and I have no plans to buy anything else in the future.","345":"Very dangerous in the rain or snow.","346":"The tires handle well and give my High Top Conversion van a comfortible ride. But I can say I wish they had a longer tread life.","347":"best tire this car has ever had, period","348":"I love the way that the tires look on my Firebird, but I feel that the tread life is extremely low.  No complains other than that.","349":"Ive been very satisfied with this tire.  Im planning on buying another set in approximately another 10K miles.","350":"I love my tires together we go places I will definetly buy another set.  Happy camper!","351":"Im using these tires on the front of my 37 Ford streetrod and they are fantastic and even look good","352":"For my needs these are very good tires.  I will definitely consider an upgrade in terms of handling issues when it is time to replace them.","353":"These tires fit the style of my classic musclecar and although the car does not see daily use, the tires seem to be holding up well. I have used them on many other projects as well, and always been pleased.","354":"These tires are on my 1998 Chev S-10 4WD Pick-Up truck. I have had BFGs on other S-10 Blazer & P\/U trucks. They have been great, and the last set had 70,000 miles on them before I had decided to replace them.","355":"I bought these for a 60s era car. I dont drive the car in rain or bad weather. Theyre great on dry pavement and seem to handle better than the tires I replaced.","356":"Classic look good size selection. Nice meats for the price!","357":"Mostly appreciate White lettering of BF goodrich to bring the car back to the 1969 camaro era.","358":"Allsome tires,would for sure buy these again,i own three vehicles, and all 3 have bf goodrich on them..In my opinon,being that Bf goodrich is such a good product, Id like to see Bf goodrich push there product to i higher level,some cool, but to a concervative level,also would like to see,on the raised wite letter tires, go to a raised in look, as well as a raised out look, as it has been for so long.Keep it up, Im rolling on T\/A\"s","359":"I have these same exact tires on three of my cars. For a classic Mustang, they are the best looking tire with white letters available and they ride smooth and handle in an acceptable fashion, at least matching the capabilities of 40 year old suspension technology.  Show cars sit more than they are driven, and the tires do not lose air or turn brown on the sidewalls like the foreign tires do.  Good product to fit the usage of my cars.","360":"These are actually mounted on a 66 Shelby Cobra on 15\" Halibrand wheels. Unfortunately there is not much to choose from in wide 15\" radials for this car. They are fine for the application as long as you dont push them too hard.","361":"these tires are not MUDS best friend.","362":"these tires look great on the car and have worked well for me. the first set of them I had wore out completly after only 35,000 miles on them.  But since there is no real option in the size that look and perform well I purchased them again.  I have only had one problem with them and that is that I have slid on ramps going on and off of the expressways.  but that is most likely the excessive speed.  I like the Tires.","363":"These tires are great in these respects: The treads will last FOREVER (unless you do donuts all the time), they make a great squeal when you mash the throttle. The perfect muscle car tire. They do lose some rear wheel traction in the rain...with some good HP numbers at boot. I manage to spin the tires for blocks in the rain. I am actually surprised that these tires handle so well on dry pavement, though. I have my Camaro set up more for cornering than drag racing, and my butt will slide off the seat before the tires make any sound around corners.","364":"This tire is truly predictable.  Have not had a set of these since 1986.  Excellent overall traction and very stable at speeds over 110MPH.  Years ago had a blow out from a FOD at 75MPH on I-5 north of San Diego and the tire held together very well.  Tire noise is a given but my Cadillacs noise insulation makes it mute.  Love the look on my Eldo. and lowered center of gravity makes this little hog of a car hug the corners very well.  I hope they never stop producing the raised white letters.  Seems to be something the other tire makers have dropped altogether.  Be safe out there folks!!","365":"Cant drive aggressively on these tires.  They have average sidewalls - not too squishy, not too hard - but they are awful in the corners unless theyre overinflated.  You can really feel the car bow and flex in the turns because the tires just dont want to stick.","366":"These TAs on my Impala convertible are a superb tire for the money!!!  Smooth, quiet, great cornering, and that great RWL look.  I hope BFG continues to make these 15\" for a long time.  How about 17\" & 18\" RWL BFG??? (I have never driven these in the rain\/snow)","367":"on wet surface tire is not confidant. Slides easy when pushed a little, this should only happend when it gets alot older,but for price its ok..","368":"i am on my 2nd set i love them","369":"GREAT TIRES. NO MATTER THE COST, I WOULD PURCHASE THESE FOREVER. THE 275\/60\/15 LOOKS REALLY GOOD WITH THE RAISED WHITE LETTERS ON MY 15X8 AMERICAN RACING BAJA 172S. EXCELLENT IN EVERY ASPECT.","370":"Went with this tire because of good reviews and recommendations.  Had the Uniroyal AWP on for one week and hated the tire; car seemed to shake at any speed.  Put the Goodrich M80 on and so far seems to be an all around good tire, excellent in snow, but very noisy on my Lincoln!  I dont know if I will be able to handle the noise, its very annoying.","371":"My big gripe with these tires is that they are extemely noisy on concrete road surfaces. The treadwear appears to be ok; nothing special. I like evrything else about them, especially the raised white letter look. ","372":"Bf Goodrich are the only tire I buy for any of my vehicals.  I have always used them, and have always been very pleased with there performance.","373":"THESE TIRES ARE GREAT ON DRY PAVEMENT AND FAIR TO GOOD IN SNOW, HAVENT FOUND A TIRE THAT DOES WELL IN SNOW YET! SOMETIMES WHEN IT RAINS, ( DOWNPOUR ) I WORRY ABOUT TRACTION AND SLOW DOWN. OTHER THEN THAT I LIKE THEM AND WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.","374":"I have had these tires on my car for 3 yrs,response to road conditions is good,wear is very good, exceptional traction. I will buy these tires again.","375":"I will continue to purchase these tires for my camaro, not only have they given my car a great look and terrific handling, but they have survived more smoke-shows and burnouts than my friends nor myself can remember. They are all believers now...","376":"Excellent cornering and straight traction tire. No noise, little shaky on highway till they warm up. Traction a little slippery in rain, but still pretty good compared to other tires. Very good biting tread for nitrous oxide assisted ","377":"LOVE THESE TIRES! THANKS!","378":"I would like a nice riding, white letter tire.  I have been making many trips to KC, KS and which is roughly 500 miles round trip.  The tires I have on now have bubbles,  plus I feel wore out from the rough ride and steering leaves my arms sore.","379":"*not a camaro, its a 1969 Chevy C10 pickup* Good looking muscle care tires. Decent traction considering my truck. 2wd Chevy pickup with no weight over the rear end. Burnouts on command with a 440hp small block. Good tire over all though. Not the most durable in a high horse-low traction set up. Tread is half burned off in 2000 miles of driving. Great traction once youre moving though.","380":"The car is a 1965 ffr cobra replica.","381":"I underrated the tire on steering responsiveness due to the slight bumpsteer that resulted in the wider tires.  Other than that, I expected a slightly harsher ride due to the shorter side walls.  These tires have been great.  I will be replacing them soon, as the vehicle has been sitting for about 4 years and is about to be put back on the road.","382":"These are on my 79 Trans Am I have owned since new and if you are looking for the muscle car look you can simply not buy a better tire. I hope they are still made for a long time to come. These replaced the original 22 year old Uniroyals three years ago. What a difference a great modern tire and lower profile can make.","383":"This is a great tire for the weekend muscle car or cruiser! I mounted a set of these on my \"79 dodge lil red express\" and fell in love with the dry traction they provided. I occasionally bracket race this vehicle at a local drag strip and they lowered my ET by 4 tenths! They are far superior to the Goodyear Eagles I had on it!","384":"Makes R\/T Dakota two wheel posi-drive truck functionable in the winter.","385":"The car these tires are on is a 1966 SS Chevelle. This auto has about 450 rear wheel horse and about the same torque. The rear tires are 265\/50\/16 and the front tires are 205\/55\/16. Driving style is straight line, fast and agressive, with hardly any cornering. Always, always on dry pavement. With that said these tires hook up very well and keep the auto in a straight line. So far they have performed great so I will buy them again.","386":"I also have Radial T\/As on my 66 Dodge Charger and they are great.","387":"I purchased a set of Dunlop GT Qualifiers from The Tire Rack last year.","388":"These tires plant well when you lay it down, but the tread just doesnt last.  Other than that theyre great.","389":"Great tires.  I will use them as long as they still make that size tire in a Radial T\/A.","390":"I like the tires.   I have had numerous sets of the BF Goodrich model.  I also have them on our 1994 Thunderbird.","391":"Radial T\/As are far better than the original tires on this car. Quiet, good traction wet and dry, good ride. Have used them for other cars, would use them for this car again.      ","392":"I have used this particular tire on many different vehicles with nothing but outstanding results.  I have had this tire on a 68 Ranchero, 73 Maverick, 78 LTD, 73 Vega w\/V8, 94 Duster, 2000 Mustang GT, 74 Nova and even a 71 VW Campmobile.  As you can see, the cars are all different weights, wheel bases, track widths, steering configurations and performance levels.  All factors that should be taken into consideration when buying the right tire. All with tremendous success.      ","393":"I purchased 4 T\/A M65s 12\/02 after 6000 mi. a goose egg developed on sidewall (not caused by bruising) and had it replaced under warranty. Im concerened (for safety) about remaining other 3. Ive contacted B.F. Goodrich but have not heard response as yet weather or not these have had previous problems. Joel Timmerman      ","394":" Definately a quality tire, discovered these for my Monte SS years ago and stuck withem. Affordability and responsiveness. Definately a tire for someone who does more then just goes from point A to B      ","395":"These tires are great for cars that never see rain or snow but when the road surface gets slippery their traction is limited at best. They are garbage in the rain.      ","396":"I put these on my 1965 Mustang Convertible and they are perfect.  The look is vinatge muscle car and with the 225\/60-15 on the car it looks beefy on the road.  The handling is very tight (I run GT springs, front and rear sway bars, and Edelbrock IAS shocks) and the tires grip the road in corners and hwy ramps at high speeds well.  The stright line ride on the hwy is smooth and the car takes bumps and potholes real well.  I had a set of these years ago and they were good then.  These updated T\/As are even better.  For a 60s muscle car, they are the best choice for price, look AND performance.       ","397":"My only complaint is that I have had difficutly in locating dealerships that carrry this particular tire.  Discount Tire has told me on at least three occassions that Goodrich no longer manufactures this particular tire.  Apparently it is a tire that has been discontinued.  if this is true then why?      ","398":"I love these tires. They grip very good I really enjoy using them. I would choose these over my other BF Goodrich 255\/50\/17 G-Force KDWS any day. For those who read this article buy these.      ","399":"Treadwear is amazing!  62000 miles later and still plenty of tread left.  Dry traction is about right, driving in the rain is scary though, and this is an AWD car with ABS!  Snow traction was good when the tires were new, but after 25% of the tread is gone then it starts to perform worse than the average all-season tire.        ","400":"Only reason I replaced the OEM tires with the same was because that was all the company would do when the originals failed. Wear down way to fast, cracks along the sidewalls and eventually blow out (has happened twice). This is all with regular maintenance.  Have always been poor for snow driving. 2nd set is failing now. Will replace with the Bridgestone Potenza 950s.       ","401":"Great tire, great price, great looks, ordered my tires on Wednesday had them by Friday morn, mounted and on car by noon. Happy with every aspect of these tires, from price to performance, the little 6 cylinder fiereo really hooks up now and corners like its on rails, Thank you.      ","402":"Great tires. Cannot beat the price. I have them on my 1979 Chevy Camaro, and put about 500 miles on them. Great dry traction (they grab the pavement pretty well on really hard acceleration) and good cornering stability. They are size 245\/60\/14, and they fit well in my Camaro. The rear tires brush the inside of the fender when I go fast over a big bump, however. Not horriblle though. The front tires clear totally, even when the wheel is turned to the stops and going over a bump. Great tire for all your second generation F-car owners out there who want to keep your stock wheels and put relitively large tires on there compared to stock sizes.      ","403":"These tires were purchased to replace the worn-out 205\/70\/15 Touring T\/As on my fullsize wagon. The Touring T\/As had impressed me greatly with their overall traction characteristics, but the sidewall was much too soft for a heavy car, and the stock 205mm tread width was of course much too narrow. I debated for many months on what to replace them with, eventually deciding on the Radial T\/A as a well-respected performance-oriented tire (i.e. I see a lot of them in Car Craft!). Even on the stock 15x6.5 rims, I noticed a vast improvement in ride comfort and overall dry handling characteristics, and though straight-line traction isnt much of an issue, its become harder to spin the right rear wheel as well. Once I put them on wider 15x8 rims (the 3.75\" backspacing doesnt hurt either except for occasional rubbing), the improvement in handling responsiveness has been phenomenal, and braking and cornering safety is much improved. However, it seems I experience hydroplaning much more easily than with the Touring T\/As when they were newer, and snow traction isnt as good as Id like, which seems to speak poorly of the tread design. They also seem to be wearing relatively quickly, and occasional plowing even in dry corners suggests the need for a wider or stickier tire. Overall, Ive been quite satisfied with these tires as a first informed purchase (versus letting a shop slap on whatever they choose), but for my next purchase, I would definitely like to see slightly more dry adhesion and improved performance in wet or snowy weather.      ","404":"These tires were put on the truck by my Grandfather who gave the truck to me a few years ago.  I must say that these tires have wonderful dry traction on paved roads and on gravel roads.  Since I live in CA, I do get the rain and I have to say that these tires were not meant for rain driving.  The tires easily lose their traction in wet driving. I must also say that the sidewalls are a little soft for this heavy of a vehicle.  The treadwear has been great on these tires.  I think I would rather add Bridgestone Dueller A\/T Revo tires for my next set though.      ","405":"This is the best set of tires I have owned. These tires came stock on my truck. They have a much better overall handling then Firestones I had on my last truck (97 F150). I have to say I am very impressed with their traction in snow. We have had one of the worst winters in many years with alot of snow and ice. Granted I do have 3.55 Limited Slip rear-end but even with no extra weight in the bed they have, in my opinion, remarkable traction in the snow and ice. I would highly recommend them to anybody regardless if your drive in the snow\/ice or not.","406":"Nice dry tyre, has decent ammount of grip. Wheel hop is a problem due to traction an torque of engine. Rain braking is difficult. Would not reccomend for a rainy climate like the West Coast.      ","407":"I have these tires on my Grand National and on my 68 Mustang. After several heavy burnouts in the GN, the rears are at around 40% and the fronts at around 80%. The GN is not a cornering car to begin with but these tires certainly do not help - I would not reccommend these tires for any type of performance driving. It is very easy to push these tires beyond their limit. In the Mustang (http:\/\/www.cardomain.com\/id\/rallyracer), which has a complete race suspension, these tires were a horrible mistake. The sidewalls roll during heavy cornering, resulting in abnormal tread wear for the front tires. If youre looking for a show tire that will occasionally be pushed, this is a great tire. However, these tires do not perform well in the rain. But with over 800 combined pounds of torque to the wheels, I guess I shouldnt be complaining.","408":"For the low price, these BFGoodrich Radial T\/As are a great looking and performing tire for hot rod or muscle car.","409":"Has excellent traction on dry road, but not to good on wet road. Tires lasted about 50,000 miles and only one tire has worn tread and needed to be replaced. Never had any problem with hydroplaning, but wheels would spin too easily from a stop on wet road. Handled well in the snow also. I replaced original stock Uniroyal tires with the B.F. Goodrich. Definitely could tell the improvement in traction. I would definetly buy these tires again for the price and dependability.","410":"I have 70K miles on these with plenty of tread left. This is the first year I have had problems with losing traction due to wet conditions. I have driven my truck off road in a foot of snow up hills without any problems. I plan on adding some weight to the back of my pickup this year to help improve traction i.e. sandbags :)","411":"My dad bought my 1978 GMC heavy half 2wd brand new and had mag slots and 275\/60R-15s put on before he ever even saw the truck. Now three sets letter i have burned down this last set but im going to put 295\/50R-15s on the back and 245\/60R-15s on the front.  In 83 my dad put a Big Block 402 in my truck that came out of a 72 EL Camino.  This motor is throwin at least 360 horses and 425 ft. lbs. of torque to the tires.  enough torque that the stock style clutch spins when i shift full throttle into third.  these tires transfer all that hp and torque to the ground better than i think any other tire could.  the only downside is the are a little slippery in the rain and defintely in the snow but that is mainly all the power the engine puts out.  and on dry pavement my truck handles better than my moms 99 Grand Prix. ","412":"These tires I have had on this truck and a 1992 Dodge Spirit I had.  Both vehicles have performed flawlessly with these tires.  Excellent all-round traction on dry roads, wet roads, icy roads, or even light off roading have presented no challenge for these tires.  I would highly recomend these tires to ANYONE.","413":"These tires are great looking but that is all they are good for.  These tires also smoke easy while doing burnouts at the drag strip.  My truck has been lowered 2\/3 and has urathane swaybar parts to improve performance but the tires poor handling makes me feel like I wasted my time and money.  The tires also have no traction in the rain, for example I could stomp on the throttle cruising at 35mph and the rear end will break loose.  These tires are very unsafe in the rain some days I wont even go on the highway when it rains because of hydroplaining.  The tires also wear more in the middle of the tire no matter what psi they are at.  The people that say they get good traction with these tires they dont know what they are talkiing about or their car just has not enough power to spin them.  The sidewalls are also very weak and roll over in the corners. ","414":"When I bought my camaro, it had two BFG TAs on the front two and some no-name tires on the back pair.  After a couple months, I replaced the backs with new BFG TAs and put the new pair on the front (the back ones had about half of their tread).  When I sold the car four months and about six thousand miles later, all four tires were ready to be replaced again.  These tires have great traction, predictable breakaway, and surprisingly decent snow traction, they just wear out pretty fast on a heavy sports car that sees aggressive driving.","415":"These tires give my 79 Z28 the nice original look with white letters.  Radial T\/A is a great performer and gives car a great look with 245\/60\/15s the whole way around.  I wouldnt have any other tires on the car.  Get lots of compliments with these tires on car.  Hard to pass on price of tires.  You can afford to burn these tires.  Radial T\/As are on majority of cars that I see when I go to cruises and shows.  Lots of big sizes is a plus for all the muscle cars and street rods.  They give you the finishing touch to your vehicle.  Recommend these to many people.","416":"tires are on a retired ford p71 police interceptor.  purchased for high mileage warranty and quiet ride.  tires are decent in dry weather, very very sloppy in wet.  very economical but not a performance tire.","417":"Excellent driving tire for this car. Handles like a new car. I tend to drive fast and hills and curves are an everyday occurance and since I have had these tires installed, I have not left the roadway once!! I do drive aggressively & fast for conditions here, coming from flat straight Florida, I am still not accustomed to the curve and hill driving here, and these tires have REALLY made quite a difference and the price was great and very hard to find raised white lettering in this size too. ","418":"I have had BFGoodrich Radial TAs on many of my past vehicle and I continue to purchase them.  They are great tire at a great price.","419":"Ive owned 3 sets of Radial T\/A's, in various sizes, on 2 cars - a '70 Camaro RS and a '70 Chevelle.  They are an overall great compromise between performance and budget, particularly for the musclecar crowd.  This tire's most outstanding characteristic has to be it's wet-weather performance, with relatively little loss of grip on slippery surfaces.  In dry conditions, the dominant trait of the tire is moderate, predictable understeer - with quite a bit of tread squirm and moaning along with it (more so than I've experienced in any other performance tire I've owned).  This tire is definitely not for the enthusiast who desires precise steering response or ultimate grip.  In extended periods of \"flat-out\" driving, Radial T\/A's can be expected to quickly but gradually overheat, eventually to the point where lateral grip will decline.  But for the driver seeking an inexpensive but sporty, quiet, and good-looking tire, these are definitely worth a look.  The abundance of available sizes doesn't hurt their appeal much either.  Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for an older American car.  On anything else, you might want to shop around some.","420":"My escort came with Goodyear tires. Hydroplaning was a problem.  Tires were worn out in 21,000 miles.  Could get traction in snow.  The B F Goodrich T\/A Radials made it a different car. Love them.","421":"I have a 1968 327 Camaro.  Though I don't drive it all that often, when I do, I am usually hard on the tires.  I am very satisfied that 7 years, about 35,000 miles, and lots of burn outs at the strip and on the street later, I am finally having to break down and buy another set just like the first.","422":"thank you for making such an sweet tire for my sport truck!!","423":"This was an inexpensive upgrade to the original 235\/70 r15 i previously had on my s-10 blazer.  I believe this is possibly the widest tire i could have purchased in this heighth and i am happy with what i have.  These tires feel sporty and have greatly improved the performance on my chevy.","424":"These tires are just slightly taller(5.3mm) than my stock 31\/10.5., but are alot wider. they have handled great on the highway and in higher speed cornering with my 5300lbs vehicle... I would recommend this tire to any Durango owner that came with the 31\/10.5's. Also, there is no tire rub at full turn.","425":" I had these type of tires on my older muscle cars and have like them.  That was the mistake.  I have bought these tires for my truck.  I used my s-10 as my driver and to pull my car hauler.  I soon had problems at 10,000 miles.  I did rotate the tires.  I had problems with the side walls cracking.  I have kept the tires infloated properly and still have wear problems.  I will not buy these tires again for truck, but for the recreational car.","426":"These tires are on a restored classic Camaro.  I only have about 50 miles on them so far.  I only drive about 500 miles per year.  The tires are great.  Very smooth ride and great handling.  It's all on dry roads.  I don't drive the car in rain or snow.","427":"Car handles great at high(85-115mph)speed.Wopuld not recomend","428":"Some of the best tires I have ever owned, and I have owned about every brand including Goodyear, Firestone, Dunlop, General, Cooper and Kelly. The last set of Kelly Chargers I had lasted 17,000 miles and were history. The Radial T\/A's have 15,000 miles currently with no noticeable wear. Excellent handling in dry and wet conditions and suprisingly good handling in snow (an important consideration since I live in the upper Midwest). Hard to find a better looking tire for cosmetic purposes with the bold looking raised white letter design (but not overstated like Firestone Firehawks in my opinion). Would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a all-season\/all weather performance oriented tire.","429":"I HAVE HAD THE LAST BFG'S FOR 6 YEARS. THEY ARE AMAZING! ILL NEVER SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT TIRE. IVE RECOMENDED THEM TO 3 PEOPLE.","430":"This is the 3rd set of Radial T\/As I have owned. I am currently shopping to step up to 17\" wheels that will fill the wheel wells as well as the BFGs I have now. PS: Pontiac actually makes cars other than Firebirds. You may wish to update your website's limitation on selection.","431":"The tires are on a car that doesn't get driven in the snow, so it's not applicable. Tires handle great in the rain, they barely slip. I will for sure buy another set once these are used up. Maybe I'll go with a wider size to further improve the handling.","432":"So far, very nice tires! I recomend!","433":"Dry traction was poor for the first few thousand miles, but has greatly improved.  The tires tread blocks wore uneven and are therefore very noisy...probably because I did not rotate them until 15k at first.  Otherwise, they have been amazingly tight and responsive for a 70 series tire, and very predictable on bumps in corners.","434":"Radial T\/A's are a great tire for their price.  My full size Chevy truck corners very well, and the tires never let loose.  The comfort and quietness of these tires are matched by very few of even the more expensive tires.  BF Goodrich designed an almost perfect light truck tire for the average consumer.  ","435":"Not too many tires available for my Saab 900 that are not MAX this or HIGH Performance that.  If your are looking for a quiet ride, with overall good comfort, traction and hydroplaning resistance this is your tire. They last 60,000 miles with regular rotoation!  I did push them with fast driving now and then without issues.  They are not Pilots but cost much less and last almost three times as long","436":"With a new set of 16\" inch wheels, I had originally wanted a set of Pirelli Sport Veloce's, but there wasn't a tire with a short enough profile (I needed 50s). So I settled for the BFGs. Judging by the other reviews posted on this site, the Radial T\/As seem most popular in powerful, muscle-car applications like Mustangs, Corvettes, and other vehicles with big block engines, so one might wonder how they would fare in a little German sedan with a 2.5l six. Well, for the most part, just fine. They provide great straight line traction and it is VERY difficult to break them loose. Even on low friction or wet surfaces, it is tough to spin out the rear end either from a standing start, or when trying to induce oversteer. In the snow its a different matter, as packed snow may as well be ice, as the tires struggle to grip. I found the handling adequate, although the steering response could not match my OEM tires, despite their shorter sidewall (50 vs. 65). Cornering was as good as stock, which is probably an indication of the quality of the car's engineering. By biggest complaint is the speed rating of these tires, as the S rating means it cannot exceed 180 km\/h (112 mph), but anywhere over 130 km\/h (81 mph) and you'll start vibrating. I wouldn't buy these tires again for this vehicle, but if I ever come across a '69 Stang that loves to peel out, I'll know where to look.","437":"Overall a good tire...cant complain too much..got 85,000 out of them! However, my complaint is that these tires do not provide very good traction in rainy conditions. In snow they arent too bad, but in slush they're useless.I have a really hard time keeping the front end under the car in slushy conditions. ","438":"Gotta tell you...When you get old and try to keep up with the newer \"trends\", you sometimes find (at a loss of money) that the old dog's tricks are better than the newer ones that they say he \"can't learn\"!  If you drive a Suburban, but aren't yet ready to \"Grow Old\", you can live quite nicely with the T\/A's.  I put 275\/60x15's on the stock 7\" rims (this is pushing it a little) and they are performing quite nicely.  Ride is actually better than the original Michelins.  Why doesn't GM put a bigger\/better tire on this truck!?!?!  After I tried Toyo 17\" Proxes ST's on a Panther 17x8 Chrome rim, and couldn't get them balanced after 14-15 attempts (really!) I decided to go back to the T\/A's that I had used in the 70's.  Guess what?  Still the best looking and best riding \"Performance Tire\" on the planet.  I guess you live and learn!  Got a Suburban?  Buy T\/A's!!  ","439":"Best tires I ever had. I use these on my Honda Civic DX. They are the widest tires the wheels will accept. Using wider tires greatly improved my stability on the road, especially while driving in high winds. I'm also impressed with the tires' longevity, as I have driven them three years in all varieties of weather conditions and locations (Appalachian mountains to New York City). ","440":"Radial T\/As kick butt! These are the best tires I've had on my car. These tires will hold in corners at speeds that would make anyone scream. Snow traction is OK but I didn't buy these for snow. Wet traction is pretty good. I had Eagle GTIIs on and they could not hold a candle to the T\/As, they wore too fast, were iffy in the corners and more expensive. Go BFGoodrich!","441":"I do a lot of off roading during the hunting season.  The BFG radial A\/T KO are the best off road tire I have owned.  The original equipment tire on my Ranger was Firestone Wilderness AT which were recalled.  I opted to put the BFG's on my Ranger since I had them on my other trucks.  The tread on these tires just last and last.  The side wall's have 3-ply construction so they don't puncture easily.  I blew out two of the Firestone sidewalls before they were recalled!  I also do a lot of driving though canyon paved roads which literally \"eat\" up the tread on other tires from all the twists and turns.  I've tried Gooyear AT\/S's, Michelin's, and Big Foot brands, but they don't even compare to the BFG's.  Dollar for dollar these are the best tires your money can buy.  (even though it sounds like a commercial, I do not work for BFG!)","442":"Excellent tire. Rides smooth. Handles very well. I deer hunt an fish a lot. These tires have been a reat help in some nasty places. However i have never had mud tires now i think i'll try the same tires in the mud brand.","443":"I purchased these tires on recommendation, they were wider than the stock tires that come on the S-10 and I was hoping for a bit more grip off the line and in cornering.  I put 265's on the back and 245's on the front.  The rears are more than half worn, if the conditions are anything less than ideal the grip is terrible.  I originally thought my Goodyear Eagle GA's were a poor tire but these BF's make them look better and better.","444":"Have not driven in the snow yet and really have not driven the car that much since it is basicly used as a spare for my GMC truck. Did take about a 500 mile trip since having the tires installed and the ride is super. This car is almost 17 years old and is like brand new with only 90k on the car. I got the car from my mother who purchased a new OLDS and she had bought this car new back in '85. This car rides super with these new T\/A's and the wider tires really look great on the Factory Chrome mag wheels.","445":" This is my second complete set of Radial T\/A's. I am very happy with them and though I plan to move up to BFG Comp T\/A HR4-2 225\/70\/15 for my next tires for more performance , I will miss my current model. BFGoodrich has won my loyalty for tires. Besides reliability and excellent performance , they have a unique attractive appearance , especially with tire dressing. You get what you pay for. ","446":" These are my second set of BFGoodrich Radial T\/A's and I've always have been happy with them for the price. They don't have the streeing response that my Brigestone Eagers had but they aren't the price of my Eagers. I woul recomend them to anyone looking for a good tire for a great price. ","447":" Probably the most humble, yet versatile tire available for light trucks. These tires represent an ideal balance between highway manners and off-road traction. You wouldn't want to use them for mud bogging or extreme terrains, but they're sure to leave any standard passenger car tire in the dust when it comes down to trail capability. ","448":" these tires seem to wear considerably more in the center. I've gone through two pairs, both wore the same, But the look and grip are great ","449":" Surprisingly good traction in snow. Thought I would need to purchase more agressive winter tires, but found these work exceptionally well in snow - I drive two mountain passes exceeding 7,000 feet every day going to work. Noisier than I like, but that may be the car's lack of sound deadening material, more than the fault of the tires. ","450":"These were the wrong tire to put on a small sports car like an MR2.  The Radial T\/A is a good tire for old muscle cars to tool around, but for someone wanting good steering response, this is about the worst tire you could have.  Tread squirm is awful!  ","451":"Great on dry highway, and excellent for mileage.  Lousy hydroplaning resistance and worse on snow.","452":"These tires have been great! The first BFGoodrich tires I have owned, and I am impressed. And I love the choice of raised white lettering or black lettering on the tires! Keep up the excellent quality and work BFGoodrich!","453":"Have great tread for where i drive.","454":" I've been very impressed with the durability and overall quality of these tires. Appearance was one of the major factors that influenced me to buy them in the first place. BF Goodrich Radials are some of the best looking tires ever made. That, and Goodrich tires have an excellent reputation. ","455":" These BFG's Have done better than ANY other tire brand I have purchased before. They have made me Strongly recommend this brand to friends. ","456":" I haven't lowered my truck yet because I haven't needed the extra handling, the tires have provided that. I am running them hard as you can possibly run them. I have at least 50 quarter mile passes on them. My truck makes 315 horses and has a top end of over 120, and the tires keep me planted and safe. ","457":" Good traction, even off road. I have used these tires for everything from a pavement only muscle truck to a dirt only rally car. It shines in daily driving, good wet traction, and good traction in gravel. My only major gripe is treadwear, I seem to go thru the tires fairly quickly, but they're so cheap its worth it. ","458":"The Vehicle I have Is actually a Chevy Caprice.  Putting these tires on this car drastically improved the looks, stability, and handling characteristics of the car.  I purchased these tires used, with about 10,000 miles on them and I have at least another 20,000 miles on them and they are just about half way gone.  I am definetly considering buying another set.  Thank you BF Goodrich and Tirerack.","459":" my present BFG's are good tires, and have lasted forever but I'm going to plus size my tires\/wheels for better handling. from 235-60-14's to 255-50-16's I'd like to see you guys \"tire rack\" sell more suspension parts. ","460":"I was replacing a set of Michelin Touring tires that the lady who owned before me had put on the car. They rode too rough. The Radial T\/A can hold the road aggressively enough to turn heads but subtle enough to keep my car in the \"luxury\" bracket. I have hydroplaned maybe once doing about 75 in the pouring rain.","461":" As a daily driver and my only car for the summer I need tires to have excellent road going abilities and the ability to take a hard launch at the local track. These tires (235\/60's) hook quite nicely and I have run a best of 13.2@99mph without any major traction problems. ","462":"Great all around tires. I need something to spice up the look of my car, and as you know the white lettering makes the car go faster.","463":" My truck came from the factory with Goodyear Eagles. These tires are ok for general use but thats not why i tried them. I couldn't get traction at the race track at all with the Eagles so I thought I'd try BFG's. These Radial T\/A's just need heated up a little and they grab very good. I am defently getting another set. ","464":"Good tire alround, but a little high on the noise level. Snow traction also could be better.","465":"Not really a performance tire, but good in the snow.  I chose these tires instead of a specific snow tire or a performance tire since I spend most of my driving time in rush hour traffic :)","466":"Wonderful all around tire. Especially in a climate where snow is common!! Tire still has enough performance to corner very responsively, and acceleration is excellent. I highly recommend this tire!! A+","467":" These are quality tires for the price and performance category, not to mention they have a great sporty look and will improve the appearance of your vehicle. I have had two pairs of BF Goodrich Radial T\/A 's on my 1972 Gran Torino Sport and bought them for my girlfriends 1996 Beretta, they are an improvement over the OEM tires, handling and cornering are much improved, treadware has been minimal. ","468":" These tires have exellent dry traction. They are also the best looking tire in that price range, but in all other areas they are pretty typical.I actually lost a little bit of steering feel, compared to the factory rubber, but I contribute that to the increase in size ( 255\/70-15 compared to 235\/75-15). The BFG's are actually slightly taller and wider, so I don't think that the loss in steering feel is due to the tire design. Next time I'm going to try a 235\/70-15 on the front and a 275\/60-15 on the rear ","469":" These are great tires for cars, but don't put them on working trucks or full-size SUVs! I've got a heavy Suburban with 15x8in. billet wheels, and when it came time for tires a few friends recommended the BFG Radials, but they just aren't built for severe duty like this. I'm gonna try the BFG Sport Trucks next, they're built more for this purpose. ","470":"This tire is a pretty good tire for minivan and a prefer them to the Pirelli P600 that I bought before, especialy for is hydroplanning resistance on heavier vehicle.","471":"Great tires for a good price.","472":"I have T\/A Radial 275\/50\/15s on the rear and 235\/60\/15s on the front.  My Turbo Regal handels well and the rear tires hook well even with 425+ hp.  I avoid driving the car in the rain because wide tires in front and back are a bad combination for hydroplaning.  The tread seems to be holding up well too.  I definitely recommend these tires for a solid street setup for 400+ hp.","473":" Excellent difficult to break these tires loose on dry pavement. Traction on slightly wet roads not good especially when moving downhill in a turn. Front-heavy cars like the GN\/Monte\/GP can experience horrible understeer sometimes losing all front traction. On dry pavement I haven't been able to break them loose capability of the tire definately exceeds my confidence in the vehicle. ","474":" Love these tires! My only complaint is that there seems to be a little more treadwear right down the middle than there should be... maybe they're a little too wide for a 15 x 7 wheel? ","475":" All things considered these are great tires. I am on my second set. Not only are they affordable but they perform wonderfully in all types of road conditions with the only possible exception being heavy snow. (But hey they're performance tires not snow tires!) The raised white lettering adds a nice touch to any classic. It simply reads \"BF Goodrich Radial T\/A\" and avoids any ridiculous modern marketing or technology jargon which would be anachronistic on a classic. ","476":" I've got an '85 Chevrolet Pickup that has been lowered 3 inches in the front and 4 inches in the back. It's got a 300hp 350 in it. These tires will barely spin when I gag it at a dead stop at 10 mph in low gear forget about them spinningI love these tires they wear out before the 35000 mark but I guarantee that they will be back on this truck when I decide to change them again. ","477":"I would reccommend these tires to anyone with a high performance car they work great in the twisties and they grip really well. I also really like the looks of them on my car!","478":" Ok tire with poor steering response (size 255\/60-SR15). The sidewalls are very soft. Dry straight line traction is surprisingly good. After looking for a high performance tire for my '71 Corvette and not finding anything better than the Radial T\/A I've decided to go to 17\" rims instead so that I can get true high performance tires.
